- **Wireframes & Design**: [3 Weeks]  
- **Backend & AWS Integration**: [4 Weeks]  
- **Frontend Development (Mobile & Web)**: [5 Weeks]  
- **Testing & QA**: [2 Weeks]  
- **Deployment**: [2 Weeks]  

**Resources**:
- **Frontend Team**: 3 Developers (React Native, Next.js)  
- **Backend Team**: 2 Developers (AWS, Node.js)  
- **UI/UX Designer**: 1  
- **DevOps Engineer**: 1  
- **Project Manager**: 1  

**Tools**:  
- GitHub for version control  
- Jira for task management  
- AWS for cloud infrastructure  
- Next.js, React Native for frontend  
- Slack/Teams for communication  

**Deliverables**:
- Mobile app (iOS, Android)  
- Web dashboard  
- Backend API with AWS S3 integration  
- Full technical documentation

### 2. **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**

#### **Functional Requirements**:
1. **Photo Upload and Offloading**  
   - The system must allow users to upload photos from their smartphones.  
   - Photos should be automatically categorized based on metadata (project name, date).  
   - Users must be able to search photos using project name, date, and metadata tags.

2. **Custom Report Generation**  
   - Users can generate custom reports (compliance, safety).  
   - Reports must include options for filtering by project and date.

3. **User Management and Permissions**  
   - Admin users can assign role-based access to team members.  
   - Roles: Project Manager, Engineer, Laborer with distinct permissions.

4. **Secure Cloud Backup**  
   - Daily automatic backups of all photos on AWS S3.  
   - Photos must be encrypted (both in transit and at rest).

5. **Notifications and Alerts**  
   - Real-time notifications about uploads, backups, and storage capacity nearing limits.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements**:
1. **Performance**  
   - Photo upload speeds must be optimized to handle large batches efficiently.  
   - All system operations (e.g., uploading, backup) must complete within 24 hours.

2. **Scalability**  
   - The system must support up to 100,000 photos per user with potential for growth.  
   - Use AWS auto-scaling features to handle increases in user traffic.

3. **Security**  
   - Multi-factor authentication for all users.  
   - All user data (including photos) must be encrypted using AWS KMS.

### 3. **Technical Design Document (TDD)**

#### **Architecture Overview**:
The **ProSite Docs** system will use a **microservices-based architecture** with the frontend and backend services deployed on AWS.

#### **Frontend**:
- **Mobile**: React Native  
- **Web**: Next.js  
- **Features**:  
  - Photo upload UI  
  - Custom report generation  
  - User role management

#### **Backend**:
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, AWS Lambda  
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for photo storage  
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 (via NextAuth), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

#### **Data Flow**:
1. **Photo Upload**:
   - Mobile app sends the photo and metadata to the backend via an API.  
   - Backend uploads the photo to S3 and stores metadata in a DynamoDB instance.  
   - Frontend receives real-time progress updates using WebSockets or similar tech.

2. **Report Generation**:
   - Backend queries the stored metadata and compiles the necessary data.  
   - Data visualization using D3.js or Chart.js for trends.

3. **User Permissions**:
   - Role-based permissions managed via a middleware layer in the backend, controlling access to different parts of the app.

---

### 4. **Test Plan (STP)**

**Objective**: Ensure that ProSite Docs meets all functional and non-functional requirements before deployment.

#### **Test Scenarios**:

- **Photo Upload & Categorization**:  
  - Verify that photos are uploaded successfully to S3 and categorized based on metadata.
  - Test on different devices (iOS, Android).

- **Backup and Encryption**:  
  - Check daily automatic backups and verify encryption at rest.

- **Custom Report Generation**:  
  - Verify that reports are generated correctly with the selected filters.

- **User Role Permissions**:  
  - Test all roles (Admin, Project Manager, Engineer, Laborer) and ensure correct permissions are enforced.

#### **Non-Functional Testing**:
- **Performance Testing**:  
  - Measure upload times for different photo batch sizes.  
  - Ensure report generation completes within acceptable time limits.

- **Load Testing**:  
  - Simulate high usage (e.g., 100 users uploading photos simultaneously) and verify system stability.

### 5. **Deployment Plan (DP)**

#### **Environments**:
- **Development**: Initial environment for developers.  
- **Staging**: Pre-production environment for integration testing.  
- **Production**: Live environment on AWS with full scaling and backups.

#### **Steps for Deployment**:
1. **Backend**: Deploy API and microservices to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk or AWS Lambda.
2. **Frontend**: Deploy Next.js web app using Vercel or AWS Amplify.
3. **Database**: Setup DynamoDB or RDS for storing metadata.
4. **Authentication**: Configure NextAuth for OAuth integration.
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**:  
   - Setup automated deployment using GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline.  
   - Run unit and integration tests before each deployment.

---

### 6. **Security Plan (SP)**

#### **Security Measures**:
- **Data Encryption**:  
  - Encrypt all photos and metadata stored in AWS S3 using KMS.  
  - SSL/TLS for all data transmitted between the frontend and backend.

- **Access Control**:  
  - Use AWS IAM policies to control access to S3 buckets.  
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for application users.

- **Compliance**:  
  - Ensure compliance with GDPR and ISO 27001 by implementing necessary data protection policies.

---

### 7. **Post-Deployment Support Plan (PDS)**

**Objective**: Ensure smooth operation of ProSite Docs after go-live.

#### **Monitoring**:
- **AWS CloudWatch**:  
  - Monitor server performance, backups, and overall system health.  
  - Setup alerts for failures (e.g., failed backups, API errors).

#### **Support**:
- **Tech Support**:  
  - Provide 24/7 support for premium customers.  
  - Use AWS SNS for critical alerts and Zendesk for customer issue tracking.

- **User Feedback**:  
  - Implement in-app feedback tools to collect user suggestions and issues.
