# **Explanation of Changes per Module**

## 1\. **Backend (NestJS)**:

-   **Improved Structure**: Migrating from Express to NestJS introduces a more modular and maintainable architecture, allowing the application to scale and improve developer productivity.
-   **Service Layer**: Splitting business logic into a dedicated service layer ensures the controller remains lightweight and easy to manage.
-   **Redis Caching**: Introducing Redis for caching frequently accessed API responses (e.g., popular product comparisons and sales data) reduces database load and improves response times.
-   **Rate Limiting and JWT**: Better API protection using rate limiting and role-based JWT authentication ensures security without significant overhead.

## 2\. **Frontend (Next.js)**:

-   **SSR and SSG**: Migrating to Next.js allows server-side rendering and static generation for pages like product details and comparison, leading to faster page load times and better SEO performance.
-   **Dynamic Routing**: Next.js simplifies dynamic routing for products and sales reports, making the application easier to extend.
-   **State Management (Recoil)**: Replacing Redux with Recoil simplifies global state management, reducing the amount of boilerplate code and improving the application's responsiveness. Selectors and atoms provide granular control over state and data fetching.

## 3\. **Database Layer (MongoDB)**:

-   **MongoDB Optimizations**: Adding **aggregation pipelines** and ensuring proper indexing speeds up complex sales and product queries.
-   **Automatic Scaling with MongoDB Atlas**: Utilizing MongoDB Atlas's built-in auto-scaling ensures the application can handle increased load without manual intervention.

## 4\. **DevOps**:

-   **CI/CD**: Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions automates testing and deployment, reducing manual work and ensuring smooth production deployments.
-   **Docker**: Containerization with Docker ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
