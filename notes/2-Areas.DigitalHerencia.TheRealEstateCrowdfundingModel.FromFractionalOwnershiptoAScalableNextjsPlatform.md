# **📌 The Real Estate Crowdfunding Model - Turning Fractional Ownership into a Scalable Next.js Platform**

> **Vision:** A Next.js-powered real estate investment platform that allows users to **buy fractional ownership** of income-generating properties—just like how **Robinhood lets users buy fractional shares of stocks.**

**Why?** Traditional real estate investing is **expensive and illiquid.** By **pooling capital from multiple investors**, you create a **crowdfunded real estate investment model** that provides **cash flow, appreciation, and liquidity** to small investors.

1️⃣ **Users buy fractions of real estate assets (just like stocks).**  
2️⃣ **Rental income is distributed proportionally to investors.**  
3️⃣ **Investors can buy, sell, or trade property shares easily.**  
4️⃣ **Liquidity is introduced through a secondary marketplace (optional).**
