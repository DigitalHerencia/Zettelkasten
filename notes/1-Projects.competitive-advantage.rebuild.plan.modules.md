# **Module-Level Optimization and Migration Plan**

## 1\. **Frontend (React + Next.js Migration)**

-   **Current Structure**:
    
    -   The application uses **React** with **Redux** for state management and **Material-UI** for component styling.
    -   Extensive use of **Nivo** for charts (e.g., time-series for sales data) and **Mapbox** for geolocation.
-   **Optimization**:
    
    -   **Migrate to Next.js** for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) to improve performance, SEO, and initial load times.
    -   **Replace Redux with Recoil** for simpler and more granular state management, reducing overfetching issues. Recoil has a more intuitive API and built-in concurrency handling thatâ€™s suited for complex applications like this one.
    -   **Improve API handling** by caching common API requests to avoid redundant calls using **SWR** (stale-while-revalidate) and **React Query** for better server-state synchronization.
    
## 2\. **Backend (Node.js + NestJS Migration)**

-   **Current Structure**:
    
    -   **Express** framework is used for routing and handling API requests.
    -   **MongoDB** for database operations, accessed via **Mongoose**.
-   **Optimization**:
    
    -   **Migrate to NestJS** for a more modular backend structure with built-in TypeScript support, which would improve scalability, modularity, and ease of testing.
    -   **Improve MongoDB queries** by using **aggregation pipelines** and ensuring proper indexing for high-performance analytics.
    -   **Add caching layer (Redis)** for frequently accessed data (e.g., popular products, market share data), which reduces load times on the backend.
    -   **Rate Limiting** to protect the API with middleware like `express-rate-limit` or **NestJS**'s own built-in guards.
    
## 3\. **Database Layer (MongoDB)**

-   **Current Structure**:
    
    -   The application uses **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** for schema definitions and data handling.
-   **Optimization**:
    
    -   Ensure proper **indexing** for frequent queries, especially in the **salesSegment** and **marketShare** modules to handle large datasets efficiently.
    -   Use **MongoDB Atlas** for automatic backups, scalability, and easy management.
    
## 4\. **State Management (Redux to Recoil)**

-   **Current Structure**:
    
    -   Redux handles state, but overfetching and unnecessary renders are causing performance issues.
-   **Optimization**:
    
    -   Migrate to **Recoil**, which offers an easier API for managing complex state without the boilerplate of Redux.
    -   Implement **selector functions** for state dependencies to reduce redundant state updates and improve component re-render efficiency.
    
## Conclusion and Next Steps

This module refactoring provide a solid foundation for the app's rebuild. The use of Next.js, NestJS, and Recoil combined with Redis caching and optimized MongoDB queries ensures improved performance, scalability, and maintainability.
