### 2.2 SOLID & Clean Code Principles

---


-   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each component will have one reason to change, ensuring maintenance simplicity.
-   **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Modules will be designed for extension without modifying existing code.
-   **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) will be used to ensure interchangeable implementations.
-   **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Components will expose minimal, specific interfaces to clients, avoiding bloated contracts.
-   **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules will not depend on low-level modules; both will depend on abstractions, enabling dependency injection.
