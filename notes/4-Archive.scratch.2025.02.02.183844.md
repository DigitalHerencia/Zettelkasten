# Hypothetical Screenplay Scenario

> ### Excerpt
> This **captures the scale of the decision**—quick turnover vs. slow, high-risk high-reward street hustle. **Either way, he’s in.**

---
## **FIRST ACT: THE "8-WEEK FLIP"**

Each borrower must **repay 150% of their loan** over **6 weeks**.  
Total repayment = **Loan amount × 1.5**

### **Lending Structure**

To achieve a **150% return**, each borrower will be charged **50% weekly interest** for 6 weeks.

| **Number of Borrowers** | **Loan Amount** | **Weekly Payment (50% Interest)** | **Total Paid Over 6 Weeks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **5 Borrowers** | **$1,600 each** | **$800 per week** | **$4,800 each** |

### **Total Collection Over 6 Weeks**

-   **Only 5 borrowers**
-   **6-week term**
-   **Weekly payments**
-   **150% total repayment (loan + interest)**



-   **2,400 x 5 = $12,000**
-   **Profit: $4,000**

___

### **Risk Considerations**

-   **Default Risk:** If one borrower defaults, the remaining 4 still generate **$9,600**, covering your initial $8,000.
-   **Collection Rate:** Strict weekly collections keep cash flow steady.
-   **Reinvestment:** If borrowers pay reliably, capital can be recycled into new loans.
