# Layout Editor Refactor Plan

## 1. Library File (e.g., layouts_library.ts)

### Purpose

Store bulk data and default configurations for the layout editor.

### Include a generic template with default grid settings, default div elements, and sample component items.

### Content Ideas

* Default grid configuration (columns, rows, gap, padding, container dimensions, etc.)
* Predefined div element templates (header, sidebar, main, footer, etc.)
* Default component items that can be populated initially.

## 2. Helper Functions File (e.g., layout_editor_helpers.ts)

### Purpose

Encapsulate common logic and operations to keep the main components lean.

### Functions to Include

* Cell Dimension Calculations: Compute cell width and height based on grid settings.
* Validation: Functions to validate and adjust child components if their dimensions exceed their parent div.
* Update Operations: Functions to update grid settings, add/remove/update div elements, and manage component items.
* Utility Functions: Functions for handling drag-and-drop events, resizing events, and recalculating layout positions.

## 3. Sub-Components

### a) Grid Component

#### Responsibility

Display and modify overall grid settings.

#### Provide UI controls (sliders, select dropdowns) to update columns, rows, padding, and gap.

#### Key Features

* Render a preview of the grid background based on the computed cell size.
* Handle adding or removing grids.

### b) Divs Component

#### Responsibility

Manage div elements (containers) within the grid.

#### Provide controls to adjust properties such as position (x, y), size (w, h), padding, border radius, and flex layout properties.

#### Key Features

* Allow adding, updating, and removing of div elements.
* Highlight the selected div element and update its properties in real time.

### c) Components Component

#### Responsibility

Manage component items that are placed within a selected div element.

#### Enable editing of component properties like margins, padding, and size.

#### Key Features

* Provide a detailed form (using sliders and select controls) for updating individual component item properties.
* Integrate with component definitions so users can select pre-made components.

## 4. Modal Component & Modal Functions File

### a) Modal Component (e.g., LayoutEditorModal.tsx)

#### Purpose

Facilitate a quick export or provide additional settings specific to layout export.

#### Pop up as a modal dialog where users can configure export options, preview export data, and trigger the export process.

#### UI Considerations

* Use minimal styling and icon-based buttons consistent with the rest of the app.
* Ensure the modal integrates seamlessly with session state for persisting layout configurations.

### b) Modal Functions File (e.g., layout_editor_modal_functions.ts)

#### Purpose

Contain functions that support modal operations.

#### Functions to Include

* Functions to assemble the export package (CSS, configuration files, etc.) for the layout.
* Functions to handle modal state transitions (open, close, save export settings).
* Any transformation logic needed to convert the current layout state into an exportable format.

## 5. Page Integration (e.g., layout-editor.page.tsx)

### Purpose

Create a dedicated page that ties all of these components together.

### Responsibilities

* Import the library data and helper functions.
* Render the three sub-components (Grid, Divs, Components) in separate sections or tabs.
* Integrate the Layout Editor Modal for quick export and advanced settings.
* Manage overall state via context or custom hooks to ensure consistency across the page.

### UI Guidelines

* Maintain a clean, minimal interface with icon buttons for actions and minimal text.
* Focus on efficiency and performance, ensuring that the layout editor loads quickly and handles updates responsively.
