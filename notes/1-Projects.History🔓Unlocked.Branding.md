## **II. Branding & Production Strategy**

### **Brand Identity**
- **Series Name:** *History Unlocked*  
- **Tagline:** *Unlocking the Past, Shaping the Future.*  
- **Visual Identity:** Strong contrast, clean fonts, historical textures (parchment, typewriter text), and a bold, yet friendly color palette.
- **Tone & Style:** Engaging, informative, and conversational—like *CrashCourse* but uniquely narrative-driven with a documentary-meets-vlog aesthetic.

### **YouTube Channel Structure**
- **Playlists by Era**: Organize videos by curriculum-aligned time periods.
- **Shorts & TikTok Clips**: Bite-sized historical facts to drive engagement.
- **Interactive Polls & Q&A Sessions**: Encourage audience participation and discussions.
- **Community Engagement**: Patreon, Discord server for student discussions, live Q&A streams.

### **Video Formatting & SOPs**
- **Video Length:** 8-12 minutes per episode.
- **Production Workflow:**
  - **Pre-production:** Research, scripting, visual planning, set design.
  - **Production:** Minimalist but dynamic—green screen, b-roll, motion graphics.
  - **Post-production:** Editing, sound design, captions, SEO optimization.

### **Episode Breakdown Format**
Each episode follows:
1. **Hook (0:00-0:30)** – Intriguing historical question, myth-busting, or dramatic re-enactment.
2. **Introduction (0:30-1:30)** – Context setting.
3. **Main Content (1:30-8:00)** – Historical narrative + analysis + visuals.
4. **Takeaway (8:00-9:30)** – Summary, modern relevance.
5. **Engagement CTA (9:30-10:00)** – Call to action for discussions, likes, and sharing.
