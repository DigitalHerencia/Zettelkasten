# Summary

This comprehensive blueprint is designed to be both a development guide and a reference document. It provides all necessary instructions, file templates, and organizational structures to implement your custom multi-GPT system. Each GPT agent is tailored to a specific responsibility, ensuring that every component—from UI to API, database models to CI/CD—meets industry standards and is integrated seamlessly.

## Complete package for your GPT system organized by team:

1. Project Team (Config Workgroup):

Custom instructions, YAML prompt template, QA template, and code examples for tsconfig, vercel.json, README.

2. App Team (Frontend Pages, Layouts, API Routes Workgroups):

- Pages: Instructions, YAML prompt template, code example (page.tsx), QA checklist.
- Layouts: Similar instructions, YAML template, layout code example (layout.tsx), QA checklist.
- API Routes: Structured prompts for API endpoints, worker code (route.ts), and QA.

3. Components Team (UI Components Workgroup):

Instructions for component prompts, worker code (Button.tsx), and QA checklist.

4. Lib Team (Models, Utils, Auth Workgroups):

- Models: YAML template for Mongoose models, code example (User.ts), QA instructions.
- Utils: YAML prompt for utility functions, code examples (helpers.ts), QA checklist.
- Auth: YAML template for auth middleware, worker code example (authMiddleware.ts), 
QA checklist.

5. CI/CD & Deployment Team:

- Pipeline: YAML prompt for CI (GitHub Actions), worker YAML example, QA checklist.
- Deployment: YAML prompt for deployment (vercel.json), worker JSON example, QA checklist.

6. Type System Team (Type Checker Workgroup):

YAML prompt for type checks, worker code example (index.ts), and QA checklist.

## Conclusion

Each file is formatted in Markdown (for instructions and QA) or in code blocks (for Worker outputs) and ready for copying into your ChatGPT Desktop environment. You can now onboard each Custom GPT agent with these instructions and start testing your multi-GPT development workflow.

You now have all the text, instructions, and file templates to set up a self-contained ChatGPT Desktop system that transforms your high-level ideas into a deployable Next.js 15 project. Enjoy building your AI-powered development workflow!
