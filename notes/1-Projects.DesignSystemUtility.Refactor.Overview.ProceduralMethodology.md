# Procedural Methodology - Feature Pages

## 1. Library Data: 

Create a dedicated libs file for:

- bulk data
- default Tailwind colors 
- font presets. 

This file will house essential data needed for each feature.

## 2. Helper Functions

Extract reusable functions into a helper file, ensuring modularity and reusability. For example color conversion functions for the Color Palette Picker.

## 3. Main Component 

Develop the main component in components/features/, focusing on core UI and functionality. Keep it lean by offloading complex logic.

## 4. Page Integration

Create a page to assemble the main component, helpers, and library data, ensuring smooth interaction and state management.

## 5. State Management

Use session storage or a custom hook for state persistence across the session, centralizing it in a session settings modal.

## 6. Quick Export Modal

Develop a quick export modal for each feature, providing export options and ensuring session data is accessible.

Applying this approach ensures consistency, modularity, and reusability across all features.
