### 1. **Cost Breakdown**:
**AWS Costs**:  
Your setup relies on AWS S3, IAM roles, and potentially KMS encryption. Here are the primary cost factors for each:

- **S3 Storage**: For each client, you expect to upload 100 photos per day, 6 days a week. Assuming each iPhone photo is around 3MB:
    - **Storage needed** = 100 photos/day * 6 days/week * 3MB = 1.8GB/week/client.
    - Over a month, each client would generate 7.2GB of storage.
    - For 10 clients, that’s 72GB of storage per month.
    - **AWS S3 pricing** for standard storage is $0.023 per GB, meaning for 72GB:
      - Storage cost = 72 * $0.023 = $1.656/month.

- **S3 PUT requests**: Each photo upload counts as one PUT request.
    - 100 photos * 6 days/week = 600 PUT requests per week/client.
    - For 10 clients: 6,000 PUT requests per week.
    - S3 charges $0.005 per 1,000 PUT requests, so weekly costs:
      - PUT cost = (6,000 / 1,000) * $0.005 = $0.03/week.
      - Monthly PUT cost = $0.12.

- **S3 GET requests (optional)**: Assuming frequent access to uploaded images, you could have high GET request usage, but for now, we’ll estimate this to be minimal unless reports are pulled regularly.

- **AWS KMS encryption**: This adds costs for encrypting/decrypting each file. Each request costs about $0.03 per 10,000 requests. Given your volume:
    - Encryption/Decryption costs = ~10,000 requests/month (for uploads and access).
    - KMS cost = $0.03.

- **IAM Roles and Permissions**: These are free in AWS unless you scale extensively with multiple users and cross-account roles.

Thus, the total **AWS monthly cost** for 10 clients would be roughly:
- **S3 storage**: $1.656
- **PUT requests**: $0.12
- **KMS encryption**: $0.03
- **Total per month**: **$1.81/month** (AWS) per client, rounded to $2 for other small charges (bandwidth, retrieval, etc.).

**Other Operational Costs**:
- **Domain Name and SSL Certificate**: ~$10/month.
- **Mobile App Maintenance (React Native)**: Estimating $50/month for app hosting and maintenance.
- **Backup and Monitoring Services**: Estimate $20/month.
- **Administrative/Business Costs**: Includes taxes, fees, LLC upkeep, software subscriptions. Estimate $100/month.

Total monthly fixed operational costs: **$180/month** (including AWS).

### 2. **Revenue Targets**:
You want to make **$60,000/year** after expenses and taxes. Let’s assume taxes are approximately 25%, meaning you need to make $80,000 pre-tax. Here’s how we calculate pricing and user numbers.

#### Pricing Plan
- **Fixed Costs per Client (AWS + Operations)**: $2 AWS cost + $18 operational costs = **$20/month/client**.
- Let’s price your service to cover expenses and make a profit.
  - A reasonable markup would be 3x your cost to ensure profit and cushion for scaling.
  - Suggested **pricing**: $60/month/client.

#### Profit Calculation
- **$60/month/client** generates $720/year/client.
- **Break-even point**: You need to cover fixed monthly costs of $180.
  - **3 clients** would cover your base costs and start generating profit.

#### Users to Reach $60,000
- To generate $80,000/year pre-tax:
  - $80,000 / $720 per client = **111 clients**.

So, you’d need about **111 clients paying $60/month** to generate $60,000 after taxes.

### Summary:
1. **Costs**: About $20/month/client in operational costs.
2. **Suggested Pricing**: $60/month/client to ensure profit.
3. **User Goal**: To hit $60,000 post-tax, you’d need 111 clients at this pricing model.
