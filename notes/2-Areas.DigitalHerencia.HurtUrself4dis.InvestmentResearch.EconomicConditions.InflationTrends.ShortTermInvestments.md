# Impact of Inflation on Investments

-  **Equities:** Inflation often leads to higher interest rates, which can slow down stock growth.
-  **Fixed Income (Bonds):** Rising inflation erodes bond yields, making short-term instruments more attractive.
-  **Commodities & Real Assets:** Precious metals like gold and real estate tend to perform well during inflationary periods.
