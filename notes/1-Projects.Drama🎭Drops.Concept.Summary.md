# **Project Overview**
___

## Comprehensive Summary and Development Guide 

DramaðŸŽ­Drops" is a cutting-edge web application designed to cater specifically to high school students within the **Gadsden Panthers community**. The platform fosters anonymous communication, enabling students to share confessions, gossip, and reactions while maintaining a safe, engaging, and highly interactive environment.

This project leverages **Next.js 15** with the **App Router**, **React 19**, and the highly customizable **Shadcn UI** framework to provide a visually modern and user-friendly interface. Its backend infrastructure integrates **MongoDB**, managed via **Prisma ORM**, to ensure scalable and efficient data handling. Authentication is powered by **Auth0**, with support for Instagram login to appeal to the younger demographic and enhance user onboarding.

The project is meticulously designed for both functionality and extensibility, aligning with best practices for modern web application development.

### **Authentication with Auth0**

**1\. Auth0 Setup**:

-   Create a new application in the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://auth0.com/).
-   Configure **Callback URLs** for login/logout (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`).
-   Enable **Instagram Login** in the Auth0 Social Connections section.

**2\. Implementation**:

-   Install Auth0 SDK:
    
    ```
    npm install @auth0/nextjs-auth0
    
    ```
    
-   Create an API route for authentication:
    
    ```
    import { handleAuth } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0';
    
    export default handleAuth();
    
    ```
    
-   Protect routes using the `withPageAuthRequired` wrapper.

### **Database Modeling with Prisma**

**Schema Definition**: The Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) models core entities such as `User`, `Post`, and `Reaction`:

```
  id            String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  name          String
  email         String   @unique
  instagramId   String?  @unique
  posts         Post[]
  reactions     Reaction[]
}

model Post {
  id            String     @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  content       String
  tags          String[]
  createdAt     DateTime   @default(now())
  author        User       @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId      String     @db.ObjectId
  reactions     Reaction[]
}

model Reaction {
  id            String     @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  type          String
  user          User       @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId        String     @db.ObjectId
  post          Post       @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
  postId        String     @db.ObjectId
}
```

**Generate Prisma Client**

```
npx prisma generate
```
