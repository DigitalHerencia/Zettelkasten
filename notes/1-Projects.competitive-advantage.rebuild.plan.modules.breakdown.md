# **Module Breakdown**

## **Backend Directory Structure**

-   **`/src/`**:
    -   **app.module.ts**: The main application module that imports all feature modules (e.g., products, sales, users). This follows the modular design encouraged by **NestJS**, making the backend code more maintainable and scalable.
        
    -   **controllers/**: The new **NestJS controllers** replace Express routes and handle incoming requests. For example:
        
        -   `products.controller.ts`: Handles product-related endpoints like `/products`, `/products/:id`, and comparison queries.
        -   `sales.controller.ts`: Handles endpoints like `/sales` and provides trend reports and data analysis.
        -   `users.controller.ts`: Manages user authentication, registration, and roles.
    -   **services/**: The business logic for each module is extracted into service files. For example:
        
        -   `products.service.ts`: Handles interactions with MongoDB through Mongoose for CRUD operations on products.
        -   `sales.service.ts`: Responsible for sales analytics using **MongoDB aggregation pipelines** and **Redis caching**.
    -   **middlewares/**: The middlewares directory contains important logic like:
        
        -   `auth.middleware.ts`: Handles JWT-based authentication.
        -   `rate-limiter.middleware.ts`: Implements rate limiting for protecting APIs from abuse using libraries like `express-rate-limit` or NestJS's equivalent.
    -   **dto/**: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are used to define the structure and validation rules for data coming into the APIs:
        
        -   `product.dto.ts`: Ensures that incoming product data (e.g., during creation) meets the expected schema.
        -   `sales.dto.ts`: Used for validating the input of sales analytics requests (e.g., date ranges, product filters).
    -   **entities/**: Contains the schema for MongoDB documents using **Mongoose models**:
        
        -   `product.entity.ts`: Defines the schema for the product document.
        -   `user.entity.ts`: Defines the schema for user management and authentication, using roles and permission levels.
    -   **modules/**: These are the NestJS feature modules, which logically group the application into separate concerns (products, sales, and users).
        
    -   **database/**:
        
        -   `mongoose.service.ts`: Handles the configuration of Mongoose, including the connection to **MongoDB Atlas**.
        -   `redis.service.ts`: Sets up the Redis caching layer to store frequently accessed API responses for improved performance.

## **Frontend Directory Structure**

-   **`/pages/`**: Migrated to **Next.js** pages with the following new structure:
    
    -   `index.tsx`: The landing page.
    -   `products/`: A folder containing dynamic product-related pages:
        -   `[id].tsx`: The product detail page, taking advantage of **Next.js dynamic routing**.
        -   `compare.tsx`: A comparison page that compares prices and details across different products.
    -   `sales/`: A folder containing sales-related pages:
        -   `index.tsx`: The sales dashboard that provides overall sales data visualization.
        -   `trends.tsx`: A dedicated page for viewing sales trends over time.
-   **`/components/`**: The reusable UI components of the application:
    
    -   `ProductCard.tsx`: Displays product information (used in product listings and comparisons).
    -   `SalesChart.tsx`: Uses Nivo to display sales trends, and now optimized with **useMemo** for reducing expensive re-renders.
-   **`/recoil/`**: The new **state management layer**:
    
    -   `atoms/`: Contains the **Recoil atoms**, which store global state:
        -   `productAtom.ts`: Stores product-related state.
        -   `salesAtom.ts`: Stores sales data.
    -   `selectors/`: Contains **selectors** that derive state and handle asynchronous data fetching:
        -   `productSelector.ts`: Handles derived state for product details and comparison data.
        -   `salesSelector.ts`: Manages data fetching and transformations for sales analytics.
-   **`/styles/`**: Modular CSS for styling the application, adhering to **Next.js's CSS module conventions** for scoped styling.
