## 6\. Operational Considerations

---

-   **Deployment:** Containerize the application using Docker for ease of deployment and scaling.
-   **Monitoring:** Integrate health-check endpoints and logging aggregation (e.g., ELK stack) for production monitoring.
-   **Documentation:** Provide extensive inline documentation, a `README.md`, and a `LICENSE` (MIT) to encourage open-source collaboration.
-   **Ethical Scraping:** Ensure compliance with legal constraints and best practices regarding web scraping.
