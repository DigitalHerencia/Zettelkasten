####  Understanding Inflation Metrics

-   **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**
    -   Measures changes in consumer goods prices over time.
    -   Key for assessing inflation's impact on spending power.
-   **Producer Price Index (PPI)**
    -   Tracks wholesale prices and serves as a leading indicator of consumer inflation.
-   **Core Inflation vs. Headline Inflation**
