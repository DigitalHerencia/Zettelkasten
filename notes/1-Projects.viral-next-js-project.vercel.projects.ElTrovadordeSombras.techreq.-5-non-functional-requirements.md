## 5\. Non-functional Requirements

---

-   **Performance:** The system shall operate asynchronously to maximize throughput and minimize latency.
-   **Scalability:** The component architecture shall allow parallel processing of multiple requests.
-   **Security:** The system shall sanitize inputs, handle sensitive data responsibly, and include proxy rotation to mitigate IP blocking.
-   **Maintainability:** The codebase will follow SOLID principles, include comprehensive unit tests, and provide clear documentation.
-   **Portability:** The solution will run on modern Python environments (3.9+) and be deployable on cross-platform systems.
