### **Where People Go Wrong (And How You Don’t Screw It Up)**

Most people:  
❌ Overthink everything and never start.  
❌ Chase trends without understanding risk.  
❌ Go in without an **exit plan** and end up stuck.

What actually works:  
✅ **Speed & Execution:** Find **one** opportunity, go all in, and iterate fast.  
✅ **Leveraging AI & Automation:** Let technology do the heavy lifting.  
✅ **Having a Liquid Exit Strategy:** Always have a **clear path to cash out.**
