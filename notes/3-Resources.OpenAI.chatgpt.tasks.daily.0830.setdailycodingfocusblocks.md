# Tasks

## Set Daily Coding Focus Blocks

**Daily - 8:30am**

- [ ] Generate a detailed 3-hour coding session schedule. Break it into Pomodoro intervals (45 minutes of focused coding followed by a 5-minute break).
   - Choose the top three tasks from the following checklist and provide an optimized sequence for tackling them.

# Next.js 15 Webapp Development Checklist

## 1\. Environment Setup
- Node.js & System Tools
  - [ ] Install the latest LTS version of Node.js compatible with Next.js 15.
  - [ ] Ensure Windows 11 Terminal and the latest PowerShell are up-to-date.
  - [ ] Configure VS Code with extensions for Next.js, React, ESLint, Prettier, and Git integration.

- Version Control
  - [ ] Initialize a Git repository.
  - [ ] Set up GitHub (or your preferred platform) for remote version control.

## 2\. Project Initialization
- Scaffold the Next.js Project
  - [ ] Run npx create-next-app@latest to create a new Next.js 15 project.
  - [ ] Verify that React 19 is being used or upgrade accordingly.
- Project Configuration
  - [ ] Decide between JavaScript and TypeScript; set up tsconfig.json if using TypeScript.
  - [ ] Configure environment variables with a .env.local file (for MongoDB URI, Clerk keys, etc.).

## 3\. Dependency Installation
- Core Packages
  - [ ] Install Next.js, React, and React-DOM (confirm versions align with your stack).
- Database & ORM
  - [ ] Install Mongoose for MongoDB interaction.
  - [ ] Add the MongoDB Node.js driver if needed.
- Authentication
  - [ ] Install Clerk packages (e.g., \@clerk/nextjs or \@clerk/clerk-react) for authentication.
- Developer Tools
  - [ ] Install ESLint, Prettier, and any additional utilities (e.g., dotenv).

## 4\. Database Integration (MongoDB & Mongoose)
- MongoDB Setup
  - [ ] Create a MongoDB Atlas account or set up a local MongoDB instance.
  - [ ] Store the MongoDB connection URI securely in .env.local.
- Mongoose Connection
  - [ ] Develop a dedicated connection module (e.g., lib/dbConnect.js) to handle MongoDB connections.
- Schema & Models
  - [ ] Define Mongoose schemas and models for core entities (e.g., users, REIT listings, transactions).

## 5\. Authentication with Clerk
- Account & Dashboard Setup
  - [ ] -  - [ ] Create and configure your Clerk account, adding your application.
- Environment Variables
Add necessary Clerk environment variables (like CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY) to .env.local.
- Integration
  - [ ] Follow Clerk’s integration guide to add authentication providers and protect routes.
  - [ ] Implement Clerk middleware or higher-order components to secure pages and API endpoints.

## 6\. Application Architecture & Routing
- Folder Structure
  - [ ] Organize your codebase into folders: /pages (or /app for the new directory structure), /components, /lib, /styles, and /api.
- Routing
  - [ ] Utilize Next.js file-based routing for static and dynamic pages.
  - [ ] Set up route guards for authenticated areas using Clerk.

## 7\. API & Serverless Functions
- RESTful API Endpoints
  - [ ] Develop API endpoints in /pages/api to handle server-side operations.
  - [ ] Secure API routes with Clerk authentication as needed.
- Database Operations
  - [ ] Use Mongoose models in API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on your MongoDB data.

## 8\. Frontend Development
- Component Development
  - [ ] Build reusable React components (e.g., forms, dashboards, listings, modals).
  - [ ] Maintain a modular and scalable component structure.
- State Management
  - [ ] Decide on using React’s Context API or a state management library (if the app’s complexity warrants it).
- Styling
  - [ ] Choose a styling solution (CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, or styled-components) and set up global styles.
- Responsiveness & Accessibility
  - [ ] Ensure all UI components are responsive and adhere to accessibility standards.

## 9\. CI/CD & Version Control
- Repository Management
  - [ ] Implement a clear branching strategy (e.g., main/develop/feature branches).
- CI Pipeline
  - [ ] Set up CI using GitHub Actions (or your CI/CD tool) to run automated tests, linters, and build checks on every push.
- Vercel Integration
  - [ ] Connect your repository to Vercel for automatic deployments on merge to main.

## 10\. Deployment on Vercel
- Project Configuration
  - [ ] Create a new project on Vercel and link it to your Git repository.
- Environment Variables on Vercel
  - [ ] Transfer all environment variables (MongoDB URI, Clerk keys, etc.) to Vercel’s dashboard.
- Deployment Testing
  - [ ] Deploy an initial version and test all critical functionalities in production mode.
- Monitoring & Rollback
  - [ ] Set up monitoring (e.g., Vercel Analytics) and define a rollback plan for production issues.

## 11\. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Unit Testing
  - [ ] Write unit tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library.
-  Integration Testing
  - [ ] Test API endpoints and database interactions.
-  End-to-End Testing
  - [ ] Consider Cypress or similar tools for critical user flows.
-  Automation
  - [ ] Integrate tests into your CI pipeline to catch regressions early.

## 12\. Documentation & Code Quality
- Internal Documentation
  - [ ] Document project architecture, API endpoints, and component usage in markdown files.
  - [ ] Use Dendron markdown style for clarity and structure.
- External Documentation
  - [ ] Create a comprehensive README outlining setup, development guidelines, and deployment instructions.
- Code Quality Tools
  - [ ] Set up commit hooks (e.g., Husky) for linting and formatting checks before commits.

## 13\. Monitoring & Analytics
- Performance Monitoring
  - [ ] Integrate performance monitoring tools to track app responsiveness.
- Error Reporting
  - [ ] Set up error monitoring with tools like Sentry.
- User Analytics
  - [ ] Configure Vercel Analytics, Google Analytics, or similar tools to understand user behavior.

## 14\. Final Review & Launch Preparation
- Code Review & Security Audit
  - [ ] Conduct comprehensive code reviews and security audits.
