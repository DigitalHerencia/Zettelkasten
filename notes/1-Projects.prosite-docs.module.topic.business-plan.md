**Business Name**: ProSite Docs  
**Owners**: Nick Dominguez and Ivan Roman (50/50 ownership)  
**Legal Entity**: LLC registered in New Mexico

### 1. **Market Research and Industry Overview**

The construction and public works industries generate massive amounts of documentation, including safety reports, project progress, and equipment logs. With the advent of smartphones, this documentation often takes the form of photos captured daily on-site. Professionals, especially in supervisory or management roles, often struggle with managing these large amounts of data, particularly if they have limited technological skills or time.

According to industry reports, 78% of construction professionals use smartphones for project management tasks, and 43% rely on daily documentation via mobile devices. The global construction industry alone is projected to grow to $14.4 trillion by 2025, with documentation and project management being key components of this growth. This presents an opportunity for a service that simplifies the transfer, organization, and storage of documentation for these professionals.

**Competitors**:
- Local IT support companies: Typically charge per hour for data management.
- Cloud storage services (Dropbox, Google Drive): Require technical setup and ongoing user management.
- Photography management services: Often cater to personal use and not the specific needs of construction professionals.

However, none of these competitors focus specifically on large-scale photo documentation solutions tailored to non-technical, industry-specific users.
