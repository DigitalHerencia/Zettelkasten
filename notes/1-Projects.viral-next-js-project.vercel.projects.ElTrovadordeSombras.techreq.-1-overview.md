## 1\. Overview

The Offender Data Scraping & Processing Tool is envisioned as a fully featured, modular, and robust system designed to harvest, parse, validate, and persist offender-related data from external web resources. The system will embody a component-based architecture that leverages contemporary software engineering paradigms such as Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, and asynchronous concurrency control. Its primary objective is to deliver reliable data extraction while mitigating risks (e.g., IP bans) and ensuring ethical compliance with external systems.
