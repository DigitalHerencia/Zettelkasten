## Pitching  my MVP and intellectual property 

Given my background and current situation, several organizations and initiatives could be receptive to  my project:

1.  **Minority Business Development Programs:**  
    -  The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers programs specifically for minority and disadvantaged entrepreneurs. The SBA's 8(a) Business Development Program, for example, helps eligible businesses access capital and mentorship.  
    -  The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) operates business centers nationwide that offer coaching, funding connections, and networking opportunities for minority entrepreneurs.
    
2.  **Local State and Regional Initiatives:**  
    -  New Mexico Small Business Development Center (NMSBDC) and local economic development agencies (such as the Albuquerque Economic Development Partnership) provide technical assistance, mentoring, and sometimes seed funding to startups in the state.  
    -  Local incubators or accelerators 
     - look for programs offered by universities or regional tech hubs in New Mexico. They often host pitch competitions and provide grants or non-dilutive funding.
    
3.  **Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Microloan Programs:**  
    -  Organizations like Kiva or Opportunity Fund offer microloans and support for entrepreneurs who face financial challenges. These programs are designed for entrepreneurs with limited access to traditional capital.
    
4.  **Real Estate and PropTech Accelerators:**  
    - Even if you lack direct contacts in real estate, there are national accelerator programs focused on real estate technology and PropTech (such as those occasionally supported by the National Association of Realtors or REIT industry groups). These programs may provide mentorship and funding if  my platform can demonstrate strong potential.  
    - Pitch competitions specifically targeting underrepresented founders (e.g., those hosted by the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce or Latino-focused startup networks) can help you gain exposure.
    

With  my background in digital media, social media marketing, and film/television productionâ€”combined with my self-taught full-stack development skills - you have a unique story and skill set that many minority entrepreneur programs value. 

I'd recommend:  
- Developing a clear pitch deck that highlights  my MVP's automated compliance/reporting features, scalability, and market opportunity in the real estate crowdfunding space.  
- Researching local New Mexico business incubators, the NMSBDC, and SBA/MBDA programs to see which match  my stage and needs.  
- Exploring national accelerators or pitch competitions for underrepresented founders in tech and PropTech.

This multi-pronged approach can help you secure support for  my MVP and IP even without pre-existing relationships in real estate.
