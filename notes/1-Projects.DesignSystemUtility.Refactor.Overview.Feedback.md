## 1. Tailwind CSS Optimization

You're using tailwind.config.ts with custom tokens and utilities.

**Recommendation:**

Use CSS-first configuration in Tailwind v4: move all tokens to @theme in CSS.

Clean up unused extend blocks, especially if tokens are already in CSS.

## 2. Dark Mode Strategy

You’re using .dark class-based dark mode in CSS and config — correct for modern setups.

**Suggestion:**

Consider exposing a dark mode toggle (mode-toggle.tsx) globally using context/provider if not already.

## 3. Component Architecture

Components are split by UI and features, which is clean.
Suggestions:

Move shared logic (use-mobile, use-toast) into a hooks/ folder for reuse (already exists — good).

Prefix feature-based components (e.g., ColorPalette, TypographyEditor) to avoid potential conflicts.

## 4. API Routes

There are multiple API endpoints under /api/fonts, /api/icons, etc.

**Suggestions:**

Consolidate API logic under a lib/api/ directory to share logic between server and edge functions.

Add runtime type validation (e.g., zod) for incoming data.

## 5. Code Cleanliness & Performance

**Suggestions:**

Use @/lib/... and @/components/... aliases consistently.

Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json if not enabled.

Optimize re-renders in large UI components with React.memo or dynamic imports.

## 6. Config Improvements

You have the correct config files: tailwind.config.ts, tsconfig.json, next.config.mjs.

**Suggestion:**

In tsconfig.json, use paths to simplify absolute imports.

Clean up unused rules in postcss.config.mjs if not using custom plugins.

## 7. Design System Extensibility

You're generating custom components via editor UIs.

**Suggestions:**

Add schema validation (e.g., JSON schema or Zod) to export routines.

Use localStorage or IndexedDB for persistence when offline.
