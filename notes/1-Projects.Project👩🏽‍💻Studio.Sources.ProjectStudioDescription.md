# Project Studio Description

Project Studio is an interactive web app that empowers developers—especially juniors—to build a complete project blueprint from scratch. With this tool, users can:

- **Define Their Tech Stack:** Select core technologies (Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS 4, ShadCN UI 2, MongoDB with Mongoose, Zod, ESLint, Prettier, and Clerk).
- **Manage Configurations:** Create and edit configuration files like `package.json`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc`, and `tailwind.config.js` using an integrated code editor.
- **Catalog Boilerplate & Templates:** Organize and preview reusable code snippets and file templates.
- **Visualize Directory Trees:** Design the project’s file structure with a drag-and-drop interface.
- **Access Documentation:** Link to curated documentation and learning resources.
- **Select UI Components:** Browse and pick prebuilt ShadCN UI components to jumpstart your UI design.
- **Codebase Visualization & Data Modeling:** Ingest an existing Next.js project (via ZIP upload or GitHub URL), analyze its structure with AST parsing, and render interactive dependency graphs and data model diagrams (ERD/UML).

## Features

- **Interactive Stack Builder:** A guided wizard to define and customize your tech stack.
- **Integrated Code Editor:** For live editing of configuration files.
- **Directory Planner & Template Catalog:** Visual and searchable interfaces.
- **Dynamic Diagrams:** Generate and interact with codebase visualizations and data model diagrams using libraries like react-flow or Mermaid.
- **API & Server Actions:** Robust backend endpoints to handle uploads, parsing, and saving configurations.

## Architecture Overview

Project Studio is built as a modular Next.js 15 application leveraging the App Router and React 19 with TypeScript 5. The design is split between a modern, interactive frontend and a robust backend that processes and analyzes project blueprints.

### High-Level Components

- **Frontend:**
  - **Dashboard:** Overview of user projects and status.
  - **Stack Builder:** A wizard interface to select and configure the tech stack.
  - **Configuration Editor:** Integrated code editor (e.g., using Monaco or CodeMirror) for modifying configuration files.
  - **Directory Tree Planner:** A drag-and-drop UI for planning the project file structure.
  - **Template Catalog:** Browse and preview boilerplate code and file templates.
  - **Docs Hub & UI Component Selector:** Curated sections for documentation links and ShadCN UI component previews.
  - **Diagrams Page:** Visualizes codebase structure (dependency graph) and data models (ERD/UML) from an uploaded or cloned project.

- **Backend:**
  - **API Routes & Server Actions:** Handle file uploads, AST parsing, diagram generation, and saving configurations.
  - **Database Layer:** For persistent storage of projects, templates, and user settings.

### Data Flow

1. **User Onboarding & Project Setup:**  
   - Users create a new project blueprint.
2. **Project Ingestion & Analysis:**  
   - Server-side actions parse the project (file system walk, AST parsing) to extract dependency graphs and data models.
     - Additionally, users upload a ZIP or provide a GitHub URL.
3. **Visualization & Interaction:**  
   - The client renders interactive diagrams using react-flow, D3.js, or Mermaid.
   - Users can explore the graphs, view code snippets, and refine their blueprints.
4. **Saving & Exporting:**  
   - Configurations, templates, and analysis results are stored for persistence and future updates.

This modular design ensures scalability, ease of maintenance, and an intuitive experience for junior developers
