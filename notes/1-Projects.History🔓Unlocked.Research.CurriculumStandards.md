### **Understanding the Educational Landscape**

Before developing a history-based educational content series, it is crucial to understand the current landscape of high school history education in the U.S. Market research helps identify key curriculum standards, the most widely used instructional frameworks, and the expectations of educational institutions. This knowledge informs content development, ensuring alignment with school requirements and maximizing potential adoption by teachers and students.

### **Most Widely Adopted U.S. History Curriculum**

High school history curricula in the U.S. are generally structured around national and state-level education standards. The most commonly adopted frameworks include:

#### **Advanced Placement (AP) U.S. History (APUSH)**
The **College Board’s AP U.S. History (APUSH)** curriculum is a widely respected, college-level course taken by over half a million students annually. The APUSH framework is rigorous, focusing on critical historical thinking skills, document-based analysis, and essay writing. Key features include:
- A thematic structure divided into **nine historical periods**, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of U.S. history.
- Emphasis on **historical argumentation**, primary and secondary source analysis, and causation.
- Standardized exam format, consisting of multiple-choice questions, short-answer responses, and document-based essays (DBQs).
- Frequent updates to maintain alignment with contemporary historical scholarship.

Since many schools offer APUSH as their primary advanced history course, aligning the *History Unlocked* video series with APUSH themes and exam preparation strategies could increase its adoption by educators and students.

#### **Common Core-Aligned State History Curricula**
Most states adhere to the **Common Core State Standards (CCSS)** for social studies and history instruction. While Common Core does not prescribe specific historical content, it emphasizes:
- **Critical thinking and analytical skills** through primary source evaluation.
- **Interdisciplinary approaches**, integrating history with literacy and civic education.
- **Standardized expectations** for historical writing and argumentative reasoning.

Aligning content with Common Core ensures that students across different states can benefit from the *History Unlocked* series while still meeting their district’s learning objectives.

#### **State-Specific History Standards**
Each state has its own unique curriculum guidelines for teaching U.S. history. Some states, such as **Texas (TEKS)** and **California (HSS Framework)**, have distinctive content requirements, emphasizing:
- **State history integration** within national historical narratives.
- **Customized approaches** to historical themes, often reflecting regional priorities.
- **Supplementary learning objectives**, including civic engagement and media literacy.

By reviewing state-specific frameworks, *History Unlocked* can develop adaptable content that appeals to a broad spectrum of schools while offering specialized modules tailored to individual state requirements.
