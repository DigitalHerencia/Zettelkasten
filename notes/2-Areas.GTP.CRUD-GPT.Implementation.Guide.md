# Implementation Instructions and Roadmap

## Step-by-Step Implementation:

### Setup GPT Agents:

1. **For each role e.g. “Frontend Page Prompter GPT”:**

- Create a custom GPT in your ChatGPT Desktop App.
- Copy the custom instructions (as provided above) into the agent’s prompt.

2. **Prepare Project Files:**

- Create a new repository with the directory structure shown above.
- Save the provided file templates (README.md, tsconfig.json, etc.) in their respective paths.

3. **Feature Development Workflow:**

- Start by inputting a feature requirement (e.g., “Create a login page”) to the appropriate Prompter GPT.
- Copy the YAML output and feed it into the corresponding Worker GPT.
- Review the generated code with the QA GPT.
- Iterate as needed and then integrate the code into your local project.

4. **Testing and Deployment:**

- Run local tests (npm run dev) and validate the integration.
- Commit changes to GitHub.
- Use the provided GitHub Actions (in ci/github-actions.yml) to run CI checks.
- Deploy to Vercel using the provided vercel.json.

5. **Maintenance and Updates:**

- Use the Type Checker Workgroup to run periodic type audits.
- Update any templates or instructions as your stack evolves.
- Document changes in the README and additional docs files.

## Roadmap for Future Enhancements:

### Automation: 

Transition from manual copy–paste to API-based orchestration as ChatGPT or IDE integrations evolve.

### IDE Plugins: 

Develop VS Code extensions to directly integrate GPT outputs into your project.

### Direct File Editing: 

Enable controlled file operations through sandboxed GPT interactions.

### Advanced Debugging: 

Integrate automated CI error analysis and self-healing code suggestions via extended GPT workflows.
