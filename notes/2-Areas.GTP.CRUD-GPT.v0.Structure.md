## Workgroup-Based GPT System

To manage complexity, the architecture divides the AI responsibilities into **focused workgroups**, each aligned with a major segment of the tech stack. This design follows a “divide-and-conquer” principle​, assigning different GPTs to specialized domains so they can work in parallel on their respective tasks. The primary workgroups are: **Frontend UI/UX**, **Backend & Database**, **CI/CD & Deployment**, and **Type System Management**. Each workgroup functions like a small team of AI agents with distinct roles:
- **Prompter GPTs** – These GPTs are like team leads or task planners. A Prompter takes high-level input (requirements, user stories, etc.) and transforms it into a structured prompt for the worker. For example, a Frontend Prompter might convert a feature description into a detailed list of UI components and behaviors needed. This structured prompting ensures the worker gets clear, scoped instructions​.
- **Worker GPTs** – These are the specialists that produce the actual outputs (code, configurations, content). A Worker GPT focuses on *one domain* (e.g. a UI coder GPT, a database schema GPT) and generates deliverables based on the Prompter’s formatted request. Because each worker is dedicated to a narrow area, it can utilize domain-specific knowledge and templates, leading to higher-quality results. This separation of concerns follows the single-responsibility principle, as each agent “has a specific role and is responsible for a particular task”.
- **QA Checker GPTs** – After a worker produces an output, a QA GPT validates it. These checkers act as quality assurance and debugging experts. They review the code or content for errors, ensure it meets the requirements and adheres to best practices (coding style, security, etc.), and can run simulated tests or logical reasoning to catch issues. If problems are found or requirements not met, the QA GPT provides feedback or instructions to refine the output​. 

In a manual setup, the user will feed this feedback back to the Worker GPT (or adjust the prompt) for revisions, creating an iterative improvement loop. This greatly improves reliability by introducing a “second pair of eyes” for each artifact.

Each workgroup operates semi-autonomously on its segment, but together they cover the full stack. For example, the Frontend group might be generating Next.js page components at the same time the Backend group is creating API route logic. The **coordination between groups** is achieved via the overall team structure (next section) and the user’s orchestration. 

Notably, this multi-agent setup yields a few key benefits: each GPT can be given **role-specific instructions and examples**, making it more effective than one generalist GPT handling everything​; and the process is transparent and debuggable, since you can inspect each step’s output and pinpoint which stage needs improvement​.

The structured chat workflow ensures information is passed in a controlled format from one GPT to the next, very much like an assembly line in a software engineering team.
