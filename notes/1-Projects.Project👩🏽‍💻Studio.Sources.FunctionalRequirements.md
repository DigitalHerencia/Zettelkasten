# Functional Requirements

This document outlines the key functional requirements for the Project Studio app.

## User Workspace
- **Personalized Workspace:**
  - The user has a dedicated dashboard showing their projects and history.

## Tech Stack Definition
- **Stack Builder Wizard:**
  - Step-by-step guided process to select core technologies (Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, ShadCN, MongoDB, etc.).
  - Preconfigured defaults based on best practices.
- **Configuration Editor:**
  - Integrated code editor for editing configuration files with syntax highlighting and linting.
  
## Template & Boilerplate Management
- **Catalog & Search:**
  - A searchable library to store, preview, and manage boilerplate code snippets and file templates.
- **Versioning & Sharing:**
  - Allow users to update and share their templates with peers.

## Directory Tree Planning
- **Interactive UI:**
  - Drag-and-drop interface to design the file structure.
  - Option to export the structure as JSON or text.
- **Real-Time Feedback:**
  - Visual cues for folder hierarchy and file relationships.

## Documentation & UI Component Selection
- **Documentation Hub:**
  - Aggregated links and summaries for key technologies.
- **UI Component Selector:**
  - Browse and preview ShadCN UI components with examples and documentation links.

## Codebase Visualization & Data Modeling
- **Project Ingestion:**
  - Users can choose the current project, upload a ZIP file, or provide a GitHub repo URL for an existing project.
- **AST Parsing & Analysis:**
  - Recursively scan the project to build a dependency graph (using TypeScript/Babel AST).
  - Identify Next.jsâ€“specific files (pages, layouts, server actions) and data models (Mongoose schemas, etc.).
- **Graph Generation & Rendering:**
  - Convert the analysis into interactive diagrams (dependency graph and ERD/UML) using libraries like react-flow or Mermaid.
  - Support zoom, pan, expand/collapse, and node selection to view code snippets.

## API & Backend Functionality
- **File Upload & GitHub Integration:**
  - API endpoint for receiving ZIP uploads or cloning from GitHub.
- **Server Actions:**
  - Endpoints to trigger AST parsing, diagram generation, and saving configurations.
- **Persistent Storage:**
  - Used for storing user projects, templates, and configuration data.

## Performance & Security
- **Efficient Parsing:**
  - Handle large projects with background processing or job queuing if needed.
- **Sandboxing & Validation:**
  - Ensure that uploaded code is parsed safely (do not execute untrusted code).
