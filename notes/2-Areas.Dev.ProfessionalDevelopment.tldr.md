### **Recap of All Lessons and How They Relate**

| Lesson | Description | How It Relates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend Development** | React, Next.js, and styling libraries. | Forms the foundation for building user interfaces. |
| **Backend Development** | API routes, databases (MongoDB, Prisma). | Supports business logic and data storage. |
| **Authentication** | NextAuth.js and Auth0. | Secures your app and personalizes user experience. |
| **Data Fetching** | React Query and server-side rendering (SSR). | Enables efficient state and server management. |
| **File Handling** | Dropzone.js and Cloudinary. | Manages media uploads and optimization. |
| **Payment Integration** | Stripe and PayPal SDKs. | Allows e-commerce functionality. |
| **Testing** | Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress. | Ensures app stability and bug-free deployments. |
| **Deployment** | Vercel hosting with CI/CD pipelines. | Delivers your app to users worldwide. |
| **Performance Optimization** | Lighthouse and monitoring with Sentry. | Improves user experience and reliability. |
| **Code Quality** | TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier. | Maintains readable, consistent, and error-free code. |

### How It All Fits Together

1. **Development Workflow**:

    - Write clean, consistent, and type-safe code with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier.
    - Test your code with Jest or React Testing Library to catch issues early.
2. **Building Features**:

    - Use React and Next.js to build dynamic UIs.
    - Fetch data and manage state with React Query.
    - Secure your app with authentication (NextAuth or Auth0).
    - Integrate payments with Stripe or PayPal.
3. **Deployment**:

    - Deploy to Vercel for fast, global delivery.
    - Use CI/CD pipelines with GitHub to automate deployments.
4. **Monitoring and Optimization**:

    - Track errors and performance with Sentry.
    - Optimize speed and accessibility with Lighthouse audits.
5. **Version Control**:

    - Manage your codebase with Git and GitHub, enabling team collaboration and history tracking.

### Final Practice Task

1. **Challenge**: Build and deploy a full-stack Next.js app with:
    - Authentication (NextAuth.js or Auth0).
    - File uploads (Dropzone.js and Cloudinary).
    - Payments (Stripe SDK).
    - Testing (Jest or Cypress).
    - Hosted on Vercel with version control on GitHub.
