## 1\. REITs Operating in New Mexico and Nearby Areas

Although New Mexico does not appear to be home to a REIT headquartered in‑state (the “REITs Headquartered” count is shown as zero on some industry sites), several large, national REITs own and operate properties in New Mexico and its immediate vicinity (roughly within 100 miles of the state line). Two common examples include:

### Extra Space Storage Properties in New Mexico

**Overview:**  
Extra Space Storage is a national self‑storage REIT. In New Mexico, you’ll find its properties in key urban areas such as Albuquerque and Rio Rancho. Although Extra Space Storage is not locally based, it is a prominent operator with a sizable portfolio across the United States.

**Operations Breakdown:**

-   **Asset Acquisition:** Extra Space Storage actively acquires self‑storage facilities in high‑demand markets. In New Mexico, it focuses on urban and suburban locations where population growth and household mobility create demand for storage.
-   **Property Management:** The REIT manages day‑to‑day operations including leasing, security, and facility maintenance. It uses standardized management practices across its portfolio to ensure high occupancy rates and streamlined operating costs.
-   **Revenue Model:** Income is generated primarily through monthly rental fees, with ancillary revenue from late fees and service charges. The business model is highly scalable with relatively low capital intensity per site compared to larger commercial or industrial assets.
-   **Market Positioning:** In New Mexico’s competitive market, a self‑storage operator benefits from relatively stable demand—even in economic downturns—as households and businesses seek affordable storage solutions.

### InnSuites Hospitality Trust

**Overview:**  
InnSuites Hospitality Trust is a publicly traded REIT focused on lodging. Although its corporate headquarters is in Phoenix, Arizona, it owns interests in properties that include an asset in Albuquerque (a Best Western InnSuites Airport Hotel & Suites).

**Operations Breakdown:**

-   **Asset Ownership & Partnerships:** InnSuites typically acquires fractional interests or direct ownership stakes in hospitality properties. In Albuquerque, it holds a significant interest in a Best Western property.
-   **Management and Branding:** The REIT may not only own but also manage hotel properties or enter into management contracts. It leverages established brands (such as Best Western) to drive occupancy and pricing power.
-   **Revenue Model:** Revenue is driven by room rental income, ancillary services (food, beverages, parking) and may also include management fees if the property is managed by an affiliate or third‑party operator.
-   **Strategic Focus:** Given its cross‑market presence, InnSuites focuses on diversification across geographic regions and hospitality sub‑sectors. In New Mexico, its role is part of a broader strategy to generate stable cash flow from key gateway markets.

## 2\. Companies with Similar Business Models But Not Regulated as Securities Offerings

In the same geographical vicinity, there are operators and platforms that use alternative real estate business models that do not necessarily fall under the typical securities‑based regulatory framework (for example, they are structured as reward‑based or fee‑for‑service platforms rather than as publicly traded securities vehicles).

### Example: Local Real Estate Crowdfunding or “Fractional Ownership” Platforms

While most investment crowdfunding platforms are structured to offer securities and must comply with federal regulations (such as Regulation Crowdfunding or Reg A+), a few platforms or local ventures have explored models that fall outside of those securities‑based frameworks. (Note that a thorough search of NM and border regions did not reveal many well‑established, locally “unregulated” platforms on a large scale; instead, many early‑stage operators tend to follow one of the federal exemptions. Nevertheless, here is the type of model sometimes observed locally:)

**Hypothetical/Smaller Platforms – Reward-Based Models:**

-   **Business Model:** Some local real estate ventures in the region may use a “crowd‑favor” or rewards‑only approach. In these cases, contributors provide funds in exchange for a one‑time “perk” (such as a discounted stay, branded merchandise, or exclusive access to an event) rather than an equity stake or profit share.
-   **Regulatory Implications:** Because the rewards are not structured as an investment and do not confer any ownership interest or profit expectation, they generally fall outside the scope of federal securities laws. These models operate much like Kickstarter, where contributors are essentially pre‑ordering a product or service rather than investing.
-   **Operations Breakdown:**
    -   **Fundraising Approach:** The platform may advertise specific real estate projects (for example, the renovation of a boutique hotel or a community‑centered mixed‑use development) and offer fixed‑level rewards if the project is funded by a set deadline.
    -   **Payouts and Refunds:** If the funding goal is reached, the contributors receive their perk (or benefit) and the project proceeds. If not, the contributions are refunded.
    -   **Revenue Streams:** Rather than relying on commissions from securities transactions, such platforms might generate revenue from listing fees charged to project developers, transaction fees on funds raised, or service fees for managing the project.
    -   **Local Focus:** Such models may be operated by local entrepreneurs who market directly to the community (via local events, social media, and partnerships with community organizations) and emphasize the local economic impact of the project.

**Note:**  
– In New Mexico and within 100 miles of the state line, most real estate crowdfunding initiatives that raise capital from a broad base of investors (even if small amounts) tend to follow federal exemptions to avoid regulatory uncertainty. Fully “unregulated” reward‑only platforms exist on a much smaller scale and are often pilot projects or niche initiatives rather than full‑scale, well‑established businesses.

## Conclusion

**REITs in New Mexico:**

-   **Extra Space Storage** and **InnSuites Hospitality Trust** are two examples of national REITs that operate properties in New Mexico. Their operations focus on, respectively, self‑storage and hospitality, with clear revenue models based on rental income, property management, and strategic asset acquisition.

**Alternative Platforms:**

-   A few local or emerging platforms in the region have experimented with business models that do not offer securities—often using reward‑based crowdfunding techniques. These models allow local community members to support projects (for example, boutique hotel renovations or mixed‑use developments) in exchange for perks rather than equity. Because these rewards do not confer an investment return, they are not regulated as securities, although such platforms must be careful with how they structure their offerings.

For both categories, further due diligence is advised to verify the details and track records of any operator before engagement.
