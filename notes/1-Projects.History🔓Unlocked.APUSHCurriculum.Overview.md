### **Introduction to AP U.S. History (APUSH) Curriculum**

The AP U.S. History curriculum is a rigorous college-level program designed to provide high school students with a deep understanding of American history from pre-Columbian times to the present. Administered by the College Board, this curriculum prepares students for the APUSH exam, which consists of multiple-choice questions, short-answer questions, document-based questions (DBQs), and long-essay questions (LEQs).
