### 3.1 Scraping Engine

-   **Responsibilities:**
    -   Initiate HTTP/HTTPS requests using asynchronous libraries (e.g., `httpx` or `aiohttp`).
    -   Respect `robots.txt` policies and incorporate adaptive rate limiting with jitter.
    -   Integrate headless browser automation (e.g., Playwright or Puppeteer via a Node.js microservice) for JavaScript-rendered pages.
-   **Interfaces:**
    -   `IScraper`: Defines methods such as `fetch_page(url: str) -> Response` and `submit_search(query: str) -> Data`.
