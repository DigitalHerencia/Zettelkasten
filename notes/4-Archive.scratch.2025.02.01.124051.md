Let’s create history—literally.

**Comprehensive Business Plan: Branded U.S. High School History Video Series**

## **Chapter 1: Executive Summary**

### **Introduction to History Unlocked**

History Unlocked is a digital educational initiative designed to revolutionize the way high school students engage with U.S. history. This project aims to provide engaging, curriculum-aligned content in video format, catering to modern learners through a dynamic, accessible, and interactive approach. By leveraging digital platforms such as YouTube and strategic licensing partnerships, History Unlocked intends to bridge the gap between traditional education and contemporary content consumption habits.

The vision behind this initiative is to create an academically rigorous yet highly engaging video series that adheres to the educational standards followed by most U.S. high schools. Designed to captivate and educate, the content is structured in a way that aligns seamlessly with state and national curriculum standards, ensuring maximum usability in formal education settings.

### **Creators and Team Structure**

The project is led by Ivan Roman, an experienced filmmaker, entrepreneur, and educator, alongside his son, Silas Roman, a history enthusiast stepping into the realm of digital content creation as his first professional endeavor. Their combined expertise in storytelling, production, and historical research forms the foundation of History Unlocked. The project’s small yet highly dedicated team will focus on efficient, high-impact production strategies, maximizing resources while maintaining quality.

Ivan Roman brings a wealth of experience in media production, having worked in various capacities, including video production, photography, and commercial media. His strategic vision for the project ensures that History Unlocked not only meets educational standards but also achieves financial sustainability through multiple revenue streams.

Silas Roman, a 16-year-old with a deep interest in history, provides a crucial perspective on what engages younger audiences. His involvement ensures that the content remains relatable and accessible to students, making learning both effective and enjoyable.

### **The Need for a Modernized Educational Approach**

Traditional high school history classes often rely on textbooks and static lecture formats, which fail to engage modern students accustomed to interactive and visually rich digital media. Studies show that video-based learning significantly improves retention rates and student engagement, making platforms like YouTube an ideal medium for educational content. By blending high-quality visual storytelling with historical rigor, History Unlocked aims to offer an alternative that enhances comprehension and long-term knowledge retention.

Furthermore, accessibility remains a key challenge in education. Many schools lack updated resources or engaging supplemental materials. History Unlocked will address this gap by providing freely available content on public platforms while also offering premium versions for schools and districts looking for additional features, such as teacher guides and assessment tools.

### **Project Goals and Objectives**

The primary goal of History Unlocked is to create a high-quality, engaging U.S. history curriculum in video format that aligns with national and state education standards. However, the project also has several secondary objectives, including:

1. **Expanding Access to Education:** Provide free and easily accessible history content for students worldwide, regardless of socioeconomic background.
2. **Enhancing Student Engagement:** Utilize storytelling techniques, animations, and dynamic visuals to make history more engaging.
3. **Ensuring Curriculum Alignment:** Develop content that adheres to Common Core, AP U.S. History (APUSH), and state-specific history curricula.
4. **Monetization & Financial Sustainability:** Generate revenue through YouTube ads, educational licensing, crowdfunding, and partnerships.
5. **Establishing Institutional Partnerships:** Collaborate with school districts, educational organizations, and historical institutions for greater reach and credibility.

### **Target Audience and Market Analysis**

The primary audience for History Unlocked consists of high school students (grades 9-12) studying U.S. history as part of their curriculum. Additionally, the content is valuable for:
- Teachers seeking engaging supplemental material for classroom instruction.
- Parents looking for high-quality educational content for homeschooling.
- College-bound students preparing for standardized tests like the AP U.S. History exam.
- General history enthusiasts interested in a well-produced, engaging series on U.S. history.

Market research indicates that digital education platforms, particularly video-based learning, are rapidly gaining traction. YouTube educational channels such as CrashCourse have proven that there is a substantial demand for well-produced, curriculum-aligned content. The success of similar projects provides a strong foundation for History Unlocked to establish itself in this space.

### **Competitive Landscape**

Several existing digital education platforms and YouTube channels provide history content, but most fall into one of the following categories:
1. **CrashCourse (John and Hank Green)** – Offers broad educational coverage, including history, but lacks deep alignment with high school curricula.
2. **Khan Academy** – Provides structured lessons, but focuses more on traditional lecture-style delivery rather than engaging narratives.
3. **PBS LearningMedia** – Produces history content but often lacks the episodic structure that keeps students engaged over time.

History Unlocked differentiates itself by combining the best aspects of these models—engaging storytelling, rigorous historical accuracy, and direct curriculum alignment—into a single, cohesive series.

### **Business Model and Revenue Streams**

While History Unlocked aims to provide free, high-quality content to students, a robust business model ensures its sustainability and continued expansion. The monetization strategy includes:

- **YouTube Monetization:** Generating revenue through ad views and sponsorships.
- **Educational Licensing:** Selling extended versions, teacher guides, and supplementary materials to schools and districts.
- **Crowdfunding & Memberships:** Offering Patreon tiers with exclusive content and behind-the-scenes access.
- **Corporate & Institutional Partnerships:** Collaborating with historical organizations, museums, and educational nonprofits.
- **Merchandising & Study Guides:** Selling branded merchandise and downloadable study materials.

### **Production and Execution Strategy**

The production of History Unlocked will be structured into well-defined phases to ensure efficiency and quality control:

1. **Pre-Production:**
   - Researching and scripting episodes aligned with curriculum standards.
   - Designing brand assets and visual identity.
   - Developing a standardized episode format and workflow.

2. **Production:**
   - Filming using cost-effective yet high-quality production techniques.
   - Incorporating animations, motion graphics, and archival footage.
   - Ensuring professional-level post-production editing.

3. **Marketing & Distribution:**
   - Launching the channel with a multi-platform strategy.
   - Engaging with educators and institutions for direct partnerships.
   - Using social media campaigns and educational outreach to grow the audience.

### **Conclusion and Next Steps**

History Unlocked represents an innovative approach to high school history education, blending storytelling, rigorous research, and modern digital engagement strategies. By combining Ivan’s expertise in media production and Silas’ fresh perspective on history engagement, the project is poised to become a significant resource in the educational landscape.

The next step is to begin the pre-production phase, refining scripts, finalizing the branding, and preparing for pilot episode production. Strategic outreach to educational institutions and YouTube optimization will further ensure a strong launch and sustainable growth.
