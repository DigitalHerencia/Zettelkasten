### **High-Level Overview for New Team Member**

#### **What We’re Building**

This project is an **AI-powered development workflow** that uses **multiple specialized GPT agents** inside the **ChatGPT Desktop App** to help **automate and streamline Next.js 15 development**. Instead of using **one general-purpose AI**, we’re building a **hierarchical system of task-specific AI agents**, each responsible for a **specific part of the stack**.

The **goal** is to take a **feature request or high-level idea** and have the AI system generate a **fully functional and validated implementation** using Next.js, React, TypeScript, MongoDB, Clerk for authentication, Tailwind, and ShadCN UI. The AI system follows a structured workflow:

1. **Prompters** – Convert high-level feature ideas into structured technical tasks.
2. **Workers** – Generate the actual code based on those structured tasks.
3. **QA Checkers** – Validate the output, debug errors, and ensure best practices.

All of this is done **inside the ChatGPT Desktop App**, with **no external API calls**, and the output is **manually copied into the project repository**. Future improvements may include **automating file handling and CI/CD integration**.
