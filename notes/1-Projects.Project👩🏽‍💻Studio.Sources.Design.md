# Design Decisions & User Experience

This document details the design decisions and UI/UX flow for Project Studio.

## Overall Vision

Project Studio is designed as a “Project Blueprint Builder” where junior developers can learn and experiment with project configuration while generating production-ready artifacts. The focus is on clarity, ease-of-use, and interactive visualizations.

## User Interface

- **Modern & Minimalistic:**  
  Use Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components to create a clean, accessible interface.
- **Guided Workflow:**  
  Implement a multi-step wizard for the Stack Builder. Each step features clear instructions, tooltips, and default configurations.
- **Interactive Visuals:**  
  - **Directory Planner:**  
    Drag-and-drop tree editor with real-time updates and export options.
  - **Diagrams:**  
    Use react-flow or Mermaid to display interactive dependency graphs and ERD/UML diagrams.
  - **Code Viewer:**  
    Clicking on a node in a diagram opens a modal or sidebar with the corresponding file or code snippet.

## Navigation & Layout

- **Dashboard:**  
  The landing page after login shows a summary of user projects, with calls to action for creating new blueprints.
- **Global Layout:**  
  A consistent header and sidebar with navigation links to the Stack Builder, Config Editor, Directory Planner, Template Catalog, Docs Hub, UI Component Selector, and Diagrams page.
- **Responsive Design:**  
  The app must work on various screen sizes, ensuring usability on tablets and desktops.

## Technical Decisions

- **Next.js 15 & App Router:**  
  Leverage file-based routing and server components for efficient rendering.
- **TypeScript & ESLint/Prettier:**  
  Ensure type safety and code consistency.
- **AST Parsing:**  
  Use the TypeScript compiler API or Babel to safely extract the project structure and model definitions.
- **Visualization Libraries:**  
  - **Interactive Graphs:**  
    Use react-flow or D3.js for dependency graphs.
  - **Static Diagrams:**  
    Optionally generate Mermaid syntax for quick static SVG diagrams.
- **Backend:**  
  API routes handle uploads and analysis, stores user data and configurations.

## User Flow

1. **Onboarding:**  
   - User is greeted with a dashboard overview.
2. **Stack Builder:**  
   - User selects core technologies and configures project defaults.
3. **Configuration Editor & Template Catalog:**  
   - User customizes configuration files and browses boilerplate templates.
4. **Directory Planning:**  
   - User designs the file structure with an interactive tree editor.
5. **Project Ingestion & Visualization:**  
   - User uploads a ZIP or enters a GitHub URL.
   - Server processes the codebase and returns JSON for diagrams.
   - User explores interactive dependency and data model diagrams.
6. **Export & Integration:**  
   - User exports the complete blueprint for integration with VCS/CI pipelines.
