### 2.1 Component Architecture & Separation of Concerns

---


-   **Modularity:** The system will be decomposed into discrete, well-defined modules:
    -   **Scraping Engine:** Orchestrates HTTP requests, concurrency management, and dynamic content processing.
    -   **Parsing & Validation Module:** Encapsulates domain-specific logic for data extraction, normalization, and validation.
    -   **Data Persistence Layer:** Manages local storage with a well-defined directory structure and concurrency-safe file operations.
    -   **Logging & Error Handling Module:** Provides advanced, verbose logging with multi-level granularity, as well as robust exception management.
    -   **Proxy & User-Agent Management:** Implements adaptive strategies to avoid IP bans and throttling through randomized headers and proxy rotation.
-   **Separation of Concerns:** Each module is responsible for a single aspect of the overall system, with clearly defined interfaces to facilitate dependency inversion and unit testability.
