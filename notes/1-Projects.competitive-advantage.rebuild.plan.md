# Comprehensive Plan to Rebuild and Optimize the Web Application

This plan outlines a detailed approach for optimizing, modernizing, and rebuilding the current **MERN stack** application. The focus will be on ensuring that the latest practices and technologies are adopted, while addressing identified weaknesses from the original stack. It also proposes effective deployment strategies, leveraging modern tools such as **GitHub** and **VS Code**.

## Rebuild Overview:

The primary focus of the rebuild will center on:

-   **Enhancing state management** by adopting more modern libraries (such as **Recoil** or **Zustand**) over Redux for better performance and flexibility.
-   **Optimizing the database** with efficient queries and indexes.
-   **Improving deployment** with a serverless architecture (using **Vercel** or **AWS Lambda**) for scalable and cost-effective management.
-   **Enhancing performance** through better use of memoization, caching strategies, and a **Next.js** migration for the frontend.



## **Deployment and Build Optimization**

### **Deployment Strategy**

-   **Current Deployment**:
    
    -   The application is built using Webpack and deployed manually to a server.
-   **Optimization**:
    
    -   **Move to Serverless** deployment on **Vercel** for frontend (Next.js) and **AWS Lambda** for backend (NestJS APIs), reducing infrastructure management overhead and costs.
    -   Set up **CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions** for automatic builds, tests, and deployments on every push.
    -   Utilize **Docker** for containerization, ensuring consistent environments for local development and production.
        
## **Improved DevOps and Code Quality**

### **VS Code + GitHub Integration**

-   **Current Setup**:
    
    -   Basic setup without integrated DevOps and collaboration tools.
    
-   **Optimization**:
    
    -   **Integrate GitHub Projects** for effective sprint planning and tracking tasks with issues and pull requests.
    -   Use **VS Code Extensions** for better collaboration:
        -   **GitHub Copilot** for automated code suggestions.
        -   **Prettier** and **ESLint** for consistent code formatting and linting.
    -   Set up **branch protection rules** in GitHub to prevent direct commits to main branches without code reviews.
