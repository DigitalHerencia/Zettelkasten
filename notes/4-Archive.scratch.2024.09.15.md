El Comanche En Chihuahua

Did you know that chihuahua means the land where two rivers meets...for me its where two souls meet... 

That picture is from Scenic drive last night I was up there looking at the the Equis and thinking about the divine feminine...and about you my darling 

I did't go because I got mad and you wanna know something crazy...I was tired and trippin and I got up got dressed and was bringing my strap because the thought of you calling my replacement enraged me...I was gonna block you...BUT I ALREADY HAVE MY LIFE NEW PLANNED OUT...and you are the most important person for setting that plan in motion baby girl..   

I don't ever want to make you jealous...in fact I want you to know if we hang with your friends you know I would be funny, charming, hilarious, thoughtful, be generous as fuck and take us all someplace sick and provide the dopest dope they ever smoked...but I  wouldn't even pay one second of attention to none of them...eyes locked on you and your grace...my jokes and stories for you...my smiles and laughs all yours...my 9mm hollow point rounds for any bastard son of a bitch that tries to replace me...

Comanche Means Enemies for Forever

They say you fall in love three timesin life : the first time is puppy love and only immature infatuation, the second is your twin flame and the lesson you learn burns fiery with lust...the third is your true love and your other half whom with you conquer the world...two bodies but one soul...

I want you to know where I am in my love life...I have been with my fair share but I have only had 2 relationships...my son's mother was my OG and was the hardest felon I knew and she more gangster than me...she moved lbs for la peeple and was caught at the checkoint with 194 lbs and had to sit down for 2 years...I held her down for 6 months meaning I took care of her while ashe was in prison...we went on the run together when she was a fugitive...after all that shit we finished college had Silas and settled down...

Then I got stabbed defending her and the baby from a  psycho who broke in to kill us...she never left my side at the hospital and helped me get through almost dieing twice...and for that I gave you everything she wanted...but after ten years we grew apart and she was holding me back honestly...

I lied about driving in J Town...I have once...my ex was an fresa Juarense with an American passport and a wealthy white-zican family that owned that big jewelry store on the main street there in J Town and they disowned her for running away with me...we drove to her moms house by the zaragosa bridge when noone was home and brought all her stuff to America in my big white 4x4 truck...I made her my buchona...from a pobrecita to a bad bitch...

We'd get high on meth and talk for days and then fuck like animals for hours...one time she didn't leave my side for 27 days straight...bathroom, shower, every second of the day together... five years later we had done just about everything toxic criminal codependent psycho lovers could do to destroy one another and it took two years, therapy, and celebacy to piece my heart back together...

The Devine Feminine

The only ones who get unconditional love are women, children, and dogs...men are loved for what they can provide...

I am motivated, ambittious, capable, strong,fearless, resolute, and completely self sufficient... an erduite iof you will...but as a man I need my wife and child and I know from experience that without my familia I cannot get to the next level...

Intimacy and romantic love create a connection that we worship at the altar in our bedroom and sexual energy is the same as creative energy...when you're with me baby the sexual pleasure is for you and my dominant yet gentle touch build to a climax and that estacsy taps into the devine feminine enregy and that loving, nurturing, and carnal devotion is what I desire and indeed yearn for because like Nata Cano says:

Es que yo pierdo el ritmo cuando me abandonas
Y me quedo solo, solo sin ti

Listening to The Universe

Nancy and Elizebeth are my favorite female names and the hottest in my opinion and I have never met one that wasn't beatiful... my whole life every weekend I get breakfast burritos and Mexicon Coke from my favorite mexican market - Casarez...i took 4 years of autoshop and condidered a career as a hotroader and even  fabricated a bit with some good friends...even though I had behavioral problems I did very well in school and graduated third in my class with a 4.125 GPA because the only people who could ever get through to me are teachers...I am obsessed with colored eyes...you are what I call the rarest swipe right: you messaged me and we hit it off right away and talked for hours...

That is extremely rare for me and I never let that go unnoticed...poeple can't deal with my intensity and deviance, they are not drawn in by my vibe and energy, and those who can are special to me because I cross oceans of time to find them and will inevitibley reach higher and higher peaks in life when I find them and flat platueas without them...my darling NEC you not only sought me out and tolerate me...girl you like me and want me just as much as I do you... 

and that is crazy and wildy extraordiniary becuase I am not for everyone...I am for the rarest of them all and the reserved special few that can see me and hear me and love me and most importantly the ones who seek me out and find me...and trust your heart when it tells you that I am the one and make no mistake those are not buterrflies in your stomache girl those are you overies going crazy for me and you are not crazy for thinking you could give all of yourself to me and be only mine and you can feel that I am special but where is the proof and how can you be sure?   
 
because the knife missed my aorta and heart by less than 1mm when I got stabbed and I walked away without a scratch from the rollover on the freeway doing 100 and every single bullet missed me when I got an extended clip dumped at me from point blank...becasuse I was the first in my family to get a bachelors and the only one with a masters and the only vato that grew dreads and called himself a filmmaker...and I have to be like one of the only successful art students with a film degree that made their money in thier field of study lol..I know I am favored and I have a gift to share and I am here for a reason...and I know I want you to be mine...and I know fate always plays a role...

La Onda 

In my favorite movie and the best representaion of the chicano experiance that I have ever found - Bound by Honor Blood in Blood Out, Micklo looks at Magic right in the eyes as they stand on the tier in the midst of a prison riot and responds to his demands for an explanation by smiling and calmly assuring his camarade:

“When you expect nothing and get everything, that’s destiny.”  

I have been wanting to start a business in Mexico and emigrate ever since economist predicted that this will be Mexico's century and tariffs, economic, and military conflict with China has created the opportunity for Mexico to lift millions of Mexicans into the middle class by trading not billions but trillions with US and for a perfect example and harbinger of the impending economic explosion look further than TJ or as it is now known - San Diego South...entire neighborhoods of americans, a booming economy, and they are even catrching people smuggling Californian cannabis into TJ...it will happen here next...I want to earn dollars and spend pesos...build an empire selling America to newly rich Mexicans...

On a more personal note...I have never liked being brown nor have I ever really enjoyed or felt connection to Hispanic or Mexican culture...indeed I would even describe being latin as the product of europeans raping the indigenous and that we are all brown bastards becuase we are the despised offshoot of the white race...on paper I am a cis white male...burgers not tacos, english not spanish, rap and rock not cumbias, worked for the military and govenment so Im USA all the way put bacon and cheese on everything and even my redneck ex-father in law onced called the brownest white boy he ever met...but then I heard the Beso Pluma song Ella Baila Solo and that changed my whole perspective...and yes that is utterly ridulous and kinda actually fucking stupid lol watch this Nata Cano vide to see how I was lured in by guitars and a trap inspired aesthetic and for the past year I have been trying to reconnect with my culture, language, and people...even though I am like 100th generation american or whatever my grandparents didn't speak english and I lived next door to them thier whole lives and grew eating fresh tortillas from grams and watchin sabado gigante with gramps...I was a space alien to them and they were dumb spics to me...now I put them up on a mantle and even put the dumb flowers I saw in the dumb little pixar movie about day of the dead (and guitars)

I look at my grandparents wedding photo everday to remember how far we've come as a familty...my garndparents were poor and uneduacated agrarians, my parents are rich, I'm over educated, and my kids will be wealthy...whatever IT is, I have some at least some in me...and most people cannot handle it...you bring peotry out of my heart and make me see visons of family and empire...and even though I am electrofied on meth it is you and only you that can make my heart pound in my chest and even though im high on the stongest weed all day, it is you and only you that makes me feel like I'm floating on a cloud...and even though I have a million ideas an hour and tons of paid projects to do and constant drama from selling drugs and so many responsibilities and hobbies and interests...it is you and only you that I think about all day and fantasize about all night...I look south more now while ruminating about life and pondering fate and if I listen closely I can almost hear destiny calling my name

...and she sounds like she has a potatoe in her mouth 

...and she wants me to put a bunch of babies in her and get a hacienda and become Don Roman and evidently show me off to all her friends lol
