## **I. LEGAL & COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS**

This kind of structure is entirely **possible**, but it must be **very carefully structured** to remain compliant with tax and corporate law, especially regarding self-dealing and unrelated business income.

### **1\. Ensuring Legal Compliance**

You'll need to **clearly separate governance** between the nonprofit and for-profit arms. The IRS scrutinizes transactions between **related entities** to prevent abuse of nonprofit tax exemptions.

‚úî **The Nonprofit (501(c)(3)) must:**

-   **Operate independently** and be mission-driven (affordable housing, social impact).
-   Have **separate directors** from the for-profit arm to avoid conflicts of interest.
-   Pay fair market value (FMV) for any real estate transactions (if leasing from the for-profit entity).
-   Be eligible for grants and tax-deductible donations.

‚úî **The For-Profit Mini-REIT must:**

-   Function **compliantly within SEC & IRS regulations** as an investment vehicle.
-   Maintain arms-length transactions with the nonprofit (no illegal subsidization).
-   Accept outside investors if necessary but **retain strategic control**.
-   Allow reinvestment of returns into the nonprofit's mission without violating IRS rules on self-dealing.

## **II. STRUCTURE MODIFICATIONS TO LEGALIZE THE LOOP**

You'll need to **slightly modify** your original Digital Herencia structure to optimize legal & tax efficiency.

### **A. The New Structure (Compliant Version)**

| **Entity** | **Purpose** | **Tax Treatment** | **Key Legal Safeguards** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Digital Herencia, Inc. (S-Corp Holding Company)** | Oversees operations & ownership | S-Corp (pass-through) | Cannot directly control the nonprofit |
| **Legatum Capital, LLC (Mini-REIT Investment Arm)** | Owns real estate investments | REIT Tax Treatment (90% of taxable income distributed) | Pays FMV rent if leasing to nonprofit |
| **Herencia Housing Foundation (501(c)(3) Nonprofit)** | Subsidizes housing for low-income tenants | Tax-Exempt | Must have separate governance from the for-profit arm |
| **DH Perpetual Trust (Asset Protection & Wealth Transfer)** | Owns the Holding Company | Trust Exemptions | Provides generational asset shielding |

‚úî **How the Money Flows Legally**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Legatum Capital (For-Profit) Acquires & Cash Flows Properties**

-   Uses investor funds & DSCR loans to buy commercial & residential real estate.
-   Collects **market-rate rent** from tenants, businesses, and short-term leases.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Nonprofit Uses Subsidies & Grants to Lease From For-Profit**

-   Nonprofit raises **grant money, donor funds, & housing subsidies**.
-   It **rents properties at FMV** from Legatum Capital (to ensure compliance).
-   It **provides affordable housing** to low-income tenants (e.g., your friend).

3Ô∏è‚É£ **For-Profit Uses Rent Revenue to Acquire More Properties**

-   The rent collected (even from the nonprofit) contributes to new acquisitions.
-   Because the nonprofit has grant funding, it **doesn't rely on the for-profit entirely**.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Nonprofit Expands, Creating More Demand for For-Profit Properties**

-   As the nonprofit scales, its rental payments continue flowing into Legatum Capital.
-   This cycle **continuously funds more real estate investments**, maintaining cash flow.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **End Result: A Closed-Loop Funding Cycle That's Legal**

-   The **for-profit grows its real estate holdings**.
-   The **nonprofit expands its affordable housing impact**.
-   The IRS stays **off your back** because everything follows **fair market principles**.

___

## **III. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS (FOR-PROFIT + NONPROFIT)**

Now that the structure is optimized, let's run **realistic numbers** on the revenue flow.

| **Category** | **For-Profit: Legatum Capital (Mini-REIT)** | **Nonprofit: Herencia Housing Foundation (501(c)(3))** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Property Acquisitions** | 5 properties @ \$350K each (\$1.75M) | Leases **2 of the 5 properties** for affordable housing |
| **Rental Revenue** | Collects \$4,000/month per property = **\$20,000/month (\$240K/year)** | Pays FMV rent on 2 properties @ \$3,500/month each = **\$7,000/month (\$84K/year)** |
| **Investor Distributions** | REIT model pays 90% taxable income to investors | N/A |
| **Grants & Subsidies** | N/A | Applies for **\$100K+ per year** in government housing grants |
| **Operating Costs (Taxes, Maintenance, Compliance)** | \$50K/year | \$40K/year |
| **Net Cash Flow (After Expenses)** | **\$190K+ (Reinvested into new properties)** | **\$60K (Reinvested into more subsidies for tenants)** |

___

## **IV. FINANCING OPTIONS**

To **fund the first property acquisitions**, you can use **both DSCR loans and nonprofit housing grants**.

| **Loan Type** | **For-Profit: Legatum Capital (Mini-REIT)** | **Nonprofit: Herencia Housing Foundation (501(c)(3))** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **DSCR Loans (Investment Properties)** | Uses **rental income** as collateral | N/A (Nonprofits don't qualify for DSCR loans) |
| **HUD Section 8 Housing Assistance** | N/A | Receives **rental subsidies** from HUD |
| **USDA Rural Housing Grants** | Only applies if properties are in rural areas | Can receive **low-cost loans & grants** |
| **Impact Investors & REIT Equity Raise** | Can raise investment capital | Can receive **philanthropic funding** |
| **Crowdfunding Campaign (Kickstarter Style)** | Used for down payments & property acquisitions | Can be used to fund nonprofit launch |

___
