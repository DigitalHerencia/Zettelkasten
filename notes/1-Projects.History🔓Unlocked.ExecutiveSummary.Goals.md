### **The Need for a Modernized Educational Approach**

Traditional high school history classes often rely on textbooks and static lecture formats, which fail to engage modern students accustomed to interactive and visually rich digital media. Studies show that video-based learning significantly improves retention rates and student engagement, making platforms like YouTube an ideal medium for educational content. By blending high-quality visual storytelling with historical rigor, History Unlocked aims to offer an alternative that enhances comprehension and long-term knowledge retention.

Furthermore, accessibility remains a key challenge in education. Many schools lack updated resources or engaging supplemental materials. History Unlocked will address this gap by providing freely available content on public platforms while also offering premium versions for schools and districts looking for additional features, such as teacher guides and assessment tools.

### **Project Goals and Objectives**

The primary goal of History Unlocked is to create a high-quality, engaging U.S. history curriculum in video format that aligns with national and state education standards. However, the project also has several secondary objectives, including:

1. **Expanding Access to Education:** Provide free and easily accessible history content for students worldwide, regardless of socioeconomic background.
2. **Enhancing Student Engagement:** Utilize storytelling techniques, animations, and dynamic visuals to make history more engaging.
3. **Ensuring Curriculum Alignment:** Develop content that adheres to Common Core, AP U.S. History (APUSH), and state-specific history curricula.
4. **Monetization & Financial Sustainability:** Generate revenue through YouTube ads, educational licensing, crowdfunding, and partnerships.
5. **Establishing Institutional Partnerships:** Collaborate with school districts, educational organizations, and historical institutions for greater reach and credibility.
