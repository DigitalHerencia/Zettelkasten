### **Video Formatting & Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**

To maintain consistency and efficiency, each episode will follow a standardized production workflow:

#### **Video Length:** 8-12 minutes per episode

This format is ideal for educational contentâ€”long enough to provide depth but concise enough to retain attention.

#### **Production Workflow:**

##### **1. Pre-Production**
- **Research:** Ensure accuracy using primary and secondary sources.
- **Scripting:** Maintain a clear narrative structure while integrating visuals.
- **Visual Planning:** Storyboarding, selecting imagery, and designing animations.
- **Set Design:** Simple, consistent backgrounds (green screen or themed set pieces).

##### **2. Production**
- **Camera Setup:** Minimalist yet high-quality approach using DSLRs or high-end smartphones.
- **Audio Quality:** External microphones to ensure clear, professional-grade audio.
- **Lighting:** Affordable LED softbox lighting to create a polished look.
- **Green Screen/B-Roll Integration:** Overlaying relevant footage, maps, and primary source visuals.

##### **3. Post-Production**
- **Editing:** Incorporating graphics, text overlays, and smooth transitions.
- **Sound Design:** Enhancing engagement with subtle background music and effects.
- **Subtitles & Captions:** Accessibility for diverse learners and global audiences.
- **SEO Optimization:** Titles, descriptions, and tags crafted for discoverability.
