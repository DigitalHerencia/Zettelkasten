**Business Plan for Photo Documentation Management Service for Pipeline/Construction Professionals**

**Executive Summary**  
This business plan outlines the creation of a professional service that assists individuals in the pipeline, construction, and public works industries with transferring and managing vast amounts of photo documentation. Leveraging the experience of Nick Dominguez and Ivan Roman, this business will offer photo offloading, storage solutions, and document management for those who rely heavily on mobile phones to capture job site data, but lack the time or tech skills to manage it themselves. The service will be branded under the name **"ProSite Docs"**, emphasizing ease of use, reliability, and professionalism, with a focus on individuals aged 50 and above who work in documentation-heavy fields.

**Business Name**: ProSite Docs  
**Owners**: Nick Dominguez and Ivan Roman (50/50 ownership)  
**Legal Entity**: LLC registered in New Mexico  
**Primary Service**: Mobile photo and document offloading and management for construction and public works professionals  
**Target Audience**: Middle-aged professionals (ages 45–65) in the pipeline, construction, and public works sectors who rely on smartphones for job documentation

---

### 1. **Market Research and Industry Overview**

The construction and public works industries generate massive amounts of documentation, including safety reports, project progress, and equipment logs. With the advent of smartphones, this documentation often takes the form of photos captured daily on-site. Professionals, especially in supervisory or management roles, often struggle with managing these large amounts of data, particularly if they have limited technological skills or time.

According to industry reports, 78% of construction professionals use smartphones for project management tasks, and 43% rely on daily documentation via mobile devices. The global construction industry alone is projected to grow to $14.4 trillion by 2025, with documentation and project management being key components of this growth. This presents an opportunity for a service that simplifies the transfer, organization, and storage of documentation for these professionals.

**Competitors**:
- Local IT support companies: Typically charge per hour for data management.
- Cloud storage services (Dropbox, Google Drive): Require technical setup and ongoing user management.
- Photography management services: Often cater to personal use and not the specific needs of construction professionals.

However, none of these competitors focus specifically on large-scale photo documentation solutions tailored to non-technical, industry-specific users.

This PRD outlines the core elements needed to develop and launch **ProSite Docs**, ensuring it meets the needs of its target audience and differentiates itself in the construction industry. Let me know if you'd like to refine or expand on any sections!

```

```
For the **ProSite Docs** project, based on the provided user stories and technical requirements, here is an industry-standard set of project planning documents and reports that are typically used during the software development lifecycle (SDLC):




```
Based on the provided documents and user stories, we can define a directory structure that organizes the project files and systems, as well as provide a starting code implementation. Below is a proposal for the directory structure and the initial code setup for the **ProSite Docs** project.



---

This setup provides a foundation for the **ProSite Docs** project. The backend handles file uploads to S3, the mobile app provides a basic UI for photo upload, and AWS infrastructure (like S3 and KMS) ensures data is stored securely. You can further expand on these by adding more features like custom report generation, user permissions, and more.

**a.** Would you like to implement custom report generation next?  
**b.** Do you need to configure the testing setup for this?

```

```
To determine the costs associated with running the ProSite Docs service, let's break down the expected expenses, including AWS costs, operational costs, and taxes. Then, based on those figures, we can create a pricing plan and calculate how many users you’ll need to meet your income goals.



Would you like help refining the pricing tiers or exploring features that could increase value for clients, such as report generation or higher-tier offerings?
