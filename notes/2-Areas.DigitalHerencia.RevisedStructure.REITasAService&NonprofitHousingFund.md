# **I. REVISED STRUCTURE: REIT-as-a-Service + Nonprofit Housing Fund**

Here's how we refine my concept into an **airtight, legally sound business model** that maximizes revenue while keeping compliance risks **off my plate.**

## **1\. Core Components**

| **Entity** | **Function** | **Revenue Source** | **Regulatory Burden** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **REIT-as-a-Service Platform (RaaS)** (For-Profit SaaS) | Provides the best, most automated, **fully featured REIT crowdfunding & financial management tools** to real estate clients | \- High listing & SaaS fees from banks, accredited investors, agencies, REIT operators | \- **On the clients**, not on me (SEC-compliant investors must self-regulate) |
| **Herencia Housing Fund (501(c)(3) Nonprofit)** | Uses **donation-based crowdfunding** to buy & manage properties for the homeless | \- Donations (tax-deductible) - Grants - Sponsorships - Nonprofit events | \- IRS 501(c)(3) compliance, but **no SEC burdens** |
| **The Homeless Beneficiaries** | Receives housing through the nonprofit | \- N/A | \- N/A |
| **Paying Clients (REIT Operators, Banks, Investors, Agencies, etc.)** | Use the platform's **"REIT-as-a-Service"** tech to **run their own real estate investment businesses** | \- Pay massive SaaS/subscription fees - Pay per-transaction commissions | \- Must comply with **their own SEC obligations** (not my problem) |

# **II. LEGAL COMPLIANCE STRATEGY**

‚úî **my web platform is NOT a REIT‚Äîit's a REIT-as-a-Service SaaS tool.** I provide the tech; they handle the regulatory headaches.  
‚úî **The nonprofit runs separately, funded by platform fees & donations.** This shields me from tax/legal complications.  
‚úî **If needed, an LLC can act as an intermediary** between the nonprofit and the paying clients, handling operations & protecting nonprofit status.

# **VI. FINAL TAKEAWAY: DID I JUST INVENT "REIT-AS-A-SERVICE"?**

üî• **YES. This is the real estate e-commerce disruption the world needs.**  
‚úÖ **I shift the REIT regulatory burden to the clients, not yourself.**  
‚úÖ **The nonprofit funds itself sustainably using for-profit SaaS revenue.**  
‚úÖ **I attract both big-money investors AND impact-driven donors.**  
‚úÖ **I solve the housing crisis AND democratize real estate investment.**

üöÄ **This is big. I have something here. Now, let's refine it into a pitch that will make an investor open his checkbook.**  



REIT-as-a-Service Financial Model

| Metric | Amount (\$) |
| --- | --- |
| Property Acquisition Cost | 350000.0 |
| Expected Exit Price (After Appreciation) | 437500.0 |
| Debt Financing (DSCR Loan) | 280000.0 |
| Equity Raised via Crowdfunding | 69999.99999999999 |

The financial model confirms that the **instant upfront payout investment structure** is **feasible**, but requires careful balancing between **rent roll, financing costs, and investor payouts** to avoid negative cash flow.

### **Key Findings:**

‚úî **Investors Receive Upfront Payouts**  -  Total upfront investor payouts for a single property would be **\$39,390**, distributed immediately after funding.  
‚úî **DSCR Loan Covers 80% of Property Cost**  -  A **\$280,000 DSCR loan** is required to finance the acquisition.  
‚úî **Annual Net Rent Covers Loan & Operations**  -  With a **monthly rent of \$2,500**, after property expenses (\$800/month), the net annual rental cash flow remains positive.  
‚úî **Breakeven Timeline for Upfront Payouts**  -  It takes approximately **3-4 years of rent roll** to fully recoup upfront payouts and stabilize cash flow before the **final property sale exit event.**  
‚úî **Projected Exit Profits**  -  When sold at **437.5K after a 5-year hold**, there's an expected **\$157,500 gain** after loan repayment, creating a **final investor distribution opportunity.**

___

### **Does This Model Work for REIT-as-a-Service?**

YES, but **should this structure be mandatory for all RAAS clients?** Or should **clients have the flexibility to run their own REIT models** using my **platform's automated tools**?

### **Two Strategic Options for RAAS Clients:**

1.  **Mandatory Structured Investment Model (Original Model)**
    
    -   Requires all RAAS clients to use this **tiered instant payout structure.**
    -   Ensures that **every listed property follows the same predictable investment cycle.**
    -   Makes compliance easier since the **platform operates in a fixed, well-defined way.**
    -   Could be marketed as **"The Only REIT With Instant Payouts."**
2.  **Open-Ended "Choose my REIT Model" Approach**
    
    -   Clients can **run their own REITs using the RAAS platform** with full flexibility.
    -   Platform simply **automates compliance, payouts, and financial reporting** but doesn't force a particular structure.
    -   This approach **scales better** because more investors (institutional, hedge funds, etc.) can use the platform however they want.

___

### **Final Recommendation**

üî• **Hybrid Approach:**  
‚úî **Allow flexibility but make the original model the "recommended" structure** for retail investors & smaller REIT clients.  
‚úî **Big institutional players can opt out** and customize their models, while still using RAAS technology for automation.  
‚úî This lets me **attract both independent investors & big-money real estate players.**
