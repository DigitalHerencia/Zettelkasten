### **Competitive Landscape**

Several existing digital education platforms and YouTube channels provide history content, but most fall into one of the following categories:
1. **CrashCourse (John and Hank Green)** – Offers broad educational coverage, including history, but lacks deep alignment with high school curricula.
2. **Khan Academy** – Provides structured lessons, but focuses more on traditional lecture-style delivery rather than engaging narratives.
3. **PBS LearningMedia** – Produces history content but often lacks the episodic structure that keeps students engaged over time.

History Unlocked differentiates itself by combining the best aspects of these models—engaging storytelling, rigorous historical accuracy, and direct curriculum alignment—into a single, cohesive series.
