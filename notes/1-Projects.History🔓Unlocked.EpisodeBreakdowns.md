### **Introduction to Episode Structure**

Each episode of *History Unlocked* follows a standardized format to ensure clarity, engagement, and alignment with **AP U.S. History (APUSH) curriculum standards**. This structured breakdown allows educators to integrate videos into their teaching plans while ensuring students receive a comprehensive, theme-based learning experience.

Each episode aligns with **College Board APUSH Key Concepts** and **historical thinking skills** (such as causation, comparison, and continuity/change over time). Additional **primary source references, discussion prompts, and interactive features** further enhance educational value.
