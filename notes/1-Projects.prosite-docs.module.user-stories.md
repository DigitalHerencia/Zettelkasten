### **Technical Requirements**

#### **Frontend (Next.js)**
1. **Mobile and Web Applications**:
   - Mobile app built using React Native with Next.js for web-based dashboard.
   - Mobile app should provide:
     - Photo offloading (uploading) UI from smartphone gallery.
     - Real-time status updates on offloading progress.
     - Storage capacity alerts and notifications.
     - Custom report generation and access to cloud-stored reports.
   - Web dashboard should allow:
     - Admin management of multiple users and projects.
     - Access to all project files, reports, and backup status.
   
2. **User Interface**:
   - Intuitive UI optimized for non-tech-savvy middle-aged users.
   - Use large buttons and clear labels for photo offloading, storage management, and report generation.
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes (tablet, smartphone, desktop).

#### **Backend (Next.js with AWS S3 Integration)**
1. **File Upload and Offloading**:
   - API endpoints in Next.js to handle file uploads from the mobile app.
   - Integration with AWS S3 to store photos securely.
   - Upload progress tracking and notifications for users.
   - Metadata tagging for automatic categorization by project, date, and tags.

2. **File Organization**:
   - Backend logic for categorizing uploaded photos using metadata (e.g., project name, date, tags).
   - Implement search functionality on the backend, allowing users to search files based on metadata.

3. **Report Generation**:
   - Backend services to compile photo data into custom reports (e.g., compliance, safety, equipment logs).
   - Simple visualization tools built using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js to display trends and status.

4. **User Management and Permissions**:
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented on the backend using NextAuth or a similar library.
   - Assign different permissions to users based on their role (project managers, engineers, laborers).

5. **Notifications and Alerts**:
   - Scheduled AWS Lambda functions or cron jobs to monitor user storage usage and send alerts when nearing capacity.
   - Push notifications for mobile users when uploads are complete or issues arise (using AWS SNS).

#### **Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)**
1. **AWS S3 for Cloud Storage**:
   - Scalable storage for user photos, with initial capacity for up to 100,000 photos per user.
   - Secure backups with automatic daily snapshots using AWS S3's versioning and replication features.

2. **Data Security**:
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit using AWS KMS and SSL/TLS.
   - Compliance with industry standards like GDPR and ISO 27001.
   - IAM policies for controlling access to S3 buckets and sensitive data.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Use AWS Auto Scaling to ensure the backend services handle increasing loads as user adoption grows.
   - Load balancing with AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic between services.

4. **Reliability and Uptime**:
   - 99.9% uptime using multi-region S3 storage and failover strategies.
   - Implement AWS CloudWatch monitoring for system health and AWS Lambda for automated error recovery.

#### **Third-Party Services**
1. **Authentication**:
   - Integrate OAuth (Google, LinkedIn) for easy login to the mobile and web app using NextAuth.
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security during login.

2. **Payment Integration**:
   - Use Stripe or AWS Marketplace for handling tiered subscription payments (basic, premium, enterprise).

3. **Push Notifications**:
   - Implement AWS SNS for sending real-time notifications about offloading, storage usage, and report generation.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements**
1. **Usability**:
   - Ensure the app and web interface are simple, with minimal clicks to perform key actions (e.g., offloading photos, generating reports).
   - Clear onboarding process with tutorials or tooltips for first-time users.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Prepare the system to handle exponential growth in photo volumes and user data.
   - Use AWS services like DynamoDB or RDS for fast access to large datasets related to photos and metadata.

3. **Performance**:
   - Upload speeds optimized for large photo batches (e.g., multi-threaded uploads to AWS S3).
   - Offloading and syncing processes should complete within 24 hours of upload.

4. **Reliability**:
   - 99.9% uptime for the cloud storage services using AWSâ€™s multi-region deployment and failover mechanisms.
