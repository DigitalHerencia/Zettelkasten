# Optimized System Architecture for Multi‑GPT Integration

## Integration into ChatGPT Desktop App

All GPT-based processes run **locally within the ChatGPT Desktop application**, requiring no external API calls. We configure multiple *Custom GPTs* in the ChatGPT Windows app – each with specialized instructions – and orchestrate them through a **manual input/output workflow**. The user acts as the coordinator, passing outputs from one GPT to the next in a structured sequence. This leverages ChatGPT’s ability to handle multi-step conversations and even interface with local tools (e.g. reading code from VS Code or the terminal if permitted​) without calling external APIs. 

The system’s design ensures that **all data remains local**, and interactions occur through ChatGPT’s UI, preserving security and offline functionality. Each Custom GPT is accessible as a separate chat (or window) in the desktop app, and their interplay is managed by following the predefined workflow (outlined below) rather than any network calls.

## Development Lifecycle Support

This architecture supports the full **software development lifecycle** from initial planning to deployment. At the **pre-production** stage, GPT agents help analyze Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) and user stories, breaking them into specifications and tasks. For example, a “Project Manager” GPT can convert a PRD into user stories and acceptance criteria, and a “Technical Architect” GPT can generate design outlines and technology choices​. 

During **prototyping and local development**, specialized GPT workgroups (detailed in the next sections) produce actual project files – front-end components, backend API routes, database models, etc. – based on those specs. The system generates advanced prompts and code scaffolds for a Vercel **v0** release, meaning an MVP of the product is prepared. Users can **download the prototype project** (the ChatGPT app now supports multi-file exports via the Projects feature) and run it locally, then push to a GitHub repository for version control.

After local testing, the project can be **deployed to Vercel** with minimal effort. The architecture includes CI/CD guidance: for example, connecting the GitHub repo to Vercel triggers automatic deployments on each push to main​. The GPT system can even provide a ready-to-use `vercel.json` config or GitHub Actions workflow. 

This covers the **deployment** phase with best practices (such as preview deployments and production rollouts). Once live, the system supports **updates and maintenance** by using the same GPT workgroups for new features or bug fixes – you would create new user stories or bug reports, then have the relevant GPTs generate patches or additional modules.

In essence, the workflow is iterative: any time in the project lifecycle, you can re-engage the GPT teams to refine requirements, adjust designs, generate new code, or produce documentation for the next release.

## Project Templates, Rules, and Resources

To enable each workgroup to function effectively, we prepare a set of **code templates, prompt templates, and reference resources** for them. These act as the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) for our AI teams​, so that each GPT agent produces output consistent with industry best practices and project conventions:

- **Code Patterns & Templates:** For every major file type in the stack, we provide boilerplate examples. For instance, the Frontend team has Next.js page and layout templates (with the correct imports, default React component structure, and placeholders for dynamic content). It also has ShadCN/UI usage examples – e.g. how to implement a modal or dropdown using ShadCN components and Tailwind classes, so the GPT can follow those patterns. The Backend team includes templates for Express-style API route handlers (or Next.js Route Handlers) with proper error handling and response format, as well as Mongoose model templates showing how to define schema, static methods, etc. The CI/CD team has sample YAML configurations for common workflows (lint, build, test, deploy), and the Type System team has a baseline `tsconfig.json` and examples of complex type definitions (like how to define an interface for a third-party library). These templates are stored in the project resources and referenced by the GPTs whenever they generate code – ensuring consistency and saving time (GPTs don’t reinvent the wheel for standard code).
- **Structured Input/Output Formats:** Prompter GPTs use predefined **prompt templates** that specify exactly how to format the task description for the Worker. For example, a Prompter might take a user story and output a JSON or YAML snippet that outlines the tasks. An example prompt from a Frontend Prompter might be: *“Given the following user story, break down the UI requirements and acceptance criteria in a structured list.”* It would then output something like:

```yaml
component: 
"LoginPage"
requirements: 
 - "Render a login form with fields: email, password" 
 - "Include a 'Forgot Password' link and a 'Sign Up' link" 
 - "On submit, call /api/login and handle loading state"
design_references: 
- "Use <Button> from UI library for the submit button" 
- "Follow Tailwind styling from design system (e.g., form field classes)"
```


This structured output is fed to the Frontend Worker GPT, which knows how to read this YAML and implement each requirement in code. Similarly, other prompters may use XML, Markdown, or JSON as needed – the format is chosen for readability and parseability. The key is that each Worker GPT expects a certain schema of input (thanks to the Prompter), making the generation task easier and more deterministic. By using structured prompts, we reduce ambiguity and help the GPT focus on filling in the specifics (this is a form of prompt chaining that improves reliability.
- **Validation Rules & QA Criteria:** Each QA Checker GPT is configured with a list of checks to perform. We provide these as part of their system prompt or via reference documents. For example, the Frontend QA has a checklist: “Ensure no unused variables, check that Tailwind classes follow the style guide, verify component is accessible (aria labels if needed), and confirm the output matches the requirement list exactly.” The Backend QA will have rules like: “Verify that all database operations are handled (no unhandled promises), ensure input validation is present for each API endpoint, and that sensitive information is not logged.” We also include known **troubleshooting guides** – e.g., common Next.js pitfalls (like forgetting to use the `use client` directive in a client-side component, or missing an `async` on a server action) so the QA can catch those. The Type System QA might actually run a dry type-check mentally by ensuring types line up between function signatures. These rules are derived from real-world best practices and can be updated as the project evolves. By codifying them for the QA GPTs, we automate a lot of the code review process.
- **Workgroup-Specific Resources:** Alongside templates, each workgroup has access to documentation excerpts and examples relevant to their domain. For instance, the Auth workgroup might have a summary of our chosen authentication strategy (say JWT with HTTP-only cookies) and an example of middleware enforcing roles or attributes for ABAC. This ensures that when the Auth GPT generates code, it aligns with the chosen approach (and uses correct libraries or functions). The Components workgroup might have design system guidelines or a palette of Tailwind classes for the theme. These resources can be provided as part of the GPT’s custom knowledge base (since Custom GPTs allow uploading or referencing documents). They function like an internal wiki or knowledge repository for our AI team.
- **Team-Level Instructions:** Each team (App, Components, Lib, etc.) is given an overview document describing how that layer of the stack should be structured and how to integrate outputs from various workgroups. For example, the App Team instructions detail that “Every page must import needed components from the Components library rather than redefining them” and “Page GPT should collaborate with API GPT if data is needed server-side.” These act as operating guidelines for the GPTs so they don’t operate in isolation. We also define a **standard response format** for each GPT role. 

Typically, code outputs are wrapped in Markdown code blocks with the appropriate language tags for easy copy-paste. Explanatory text (if any) should be minimal or in comments, since the goal is to produce ready-to-use code that can be directly saved to files. Consistent formatting (like including file names in headings or delimiters) is enforced so that when the user is collating the outputs, it’s clear which content goes into which file. All these conventions are documented and examples are given, so each GPT knows how to output its answer in a way that the next GPT (or the user) can readily consume. 

By preparing these templates and rules, we effectively **train each GPT on our project’s best practices and style** without needing actual fine-tuning. It’s akin to providing every new (human) team member with an onboarding document and code style guide. The GPT workgroups use them to ensure coherence across the entire codebase even though different "agents" are producing different parts. This mitigates the risk of the project pieces feeling disjointed or inconsistent. It also speeds up prompt design: rather than writing each prompt from scratch, the Prompters have a library of prompt examples to draw from (for instance, how to prompt for creating a React component vs. how to prompt for creating a database model).
