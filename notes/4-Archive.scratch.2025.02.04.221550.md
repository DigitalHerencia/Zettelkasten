_Prepared for: Ivan Roman | February 2025_

___

**Executive Summary**

To enhance your development workflow by minimizing context switching between ChatGPT and Visual Studio Code (VS Code), we propose creating a custom GPT that functions as a senior software engineer. This GPT will be tailored to interact directly with your VS Code environment on Windows 11 Pro, leveraging custom actions, relevant extensions, and advanced configurations to provide context-aware code manipulation. The goal is to develop a no-code solution that emulates the capabilities of tools like GitHub Copilot, customized to your specific development style and environment.

___

**1\. Integration Strategy**

**1.1. VS Code Extensions**

To enable seamless interaction between the custom GPT and VS Code:

-   **CodeGPT Extension**: Integrate the CodeGPT extension into VS Code to facilitate direct communication with the GPT model. This extension allows for in-editor code generation, explanation, and refactoring.

**1.2. Custom Actions via GPT Builder**

Utilize OpenAI's GPT Builder to define custom actions that the GPT can perform within VS Code:

-   **File System Access**: Configure actions that allow the GPT to read from and write to files in your project directory, enabling it to analyze and modify code directly.
    
-   **Command Execution**: Set up actions to execute VS Code commands, such as running scripts, formatting code, or triggering extensions.
    

___

**2\. Context Management for Large Codebases**

To ensure the GPT maintains a comprehensive understanding of your codebase:

**2.1. Project Configuration Analysis**

-   **Automated Parsing**: Implement routines that parse configuration files like `tsconfig.json`, `.eslintrc`, and `package.json` to understand project settings, dependencies, and scripts.

**2.2. Dependency Mapping**

-   **Import/Export Analysis**: Develop a system to map out the relationships between modules by analyzing import and export statements, ensuring the GPT

Review all of the information in this thread and use these concepts along with additional research on the internet to incorporate the most advanced techniques and innovative methods to provide optimal gold standard super high level instructions, configs, branding, custom actions, assets, etc for me to input in the openAI no code custom gpt creation tool from the chat gpt website The gpt should be a professional senior software engineer that can manipulate code that I’m developing on my networked windows 11 pro version of vs code and uses custom actions in the no code tool, all of vs codes relevant functionality, custom api endpoints, relevant vs code extensions that offer relevant features and any other tricks you keep up your sleeves to make magic happen! My user story is I’m tired of copying and pasting in and out of chat gpt/vs code and I want to automate that or give the gpt tools to create/edit directly within vs code, also I need the best way available to provide context for the gpt so large codebases don’t get broken because of inconsistency or incompatibility or in other words so that the gpt doesn’t make edits to the code in one module that breaks a bunch of code in other modules…for example knowing Params or props or typescript types or imports/exports or installed dependencies or configurations like tsconfig or eslintrc and so on So basically a free no code version of vs code GitHub copilot custom tailored for my specific purposes and optimized for my development style and machine If possible utilize a multi agent hierarchy that integrates an industry standard optimal workflow with specialized roles for each agent based on irl organization structure optimized for our purposes (no api only no code openAI online creation tool and if possible multiple GPTs that can independently programmatically communicate and collaborate amongst themselves) or in other words agents that code with separate front and back end developers, others that are senior devs that manage jr devs and review code quality, separate agents for customer service reps to act as a liaison for the user and the other agents, specialized designers and architects, logistics agents for scheduling and planning and allocation of resources, a master agent that oversees the whole process to completion and breaks infinite loops when the agents get stuck or fail to advance through the dev process and so on
