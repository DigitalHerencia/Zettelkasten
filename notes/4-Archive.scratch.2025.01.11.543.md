    <div class="contain-inline-size rounded-md border-[0.5px] border-token-border-medium relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary dark:bg-gray-950"><div class="flex items-center text-token-text-secondary px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md h-9 bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary select-none">bash</div><div class="sticky top-9 md:top-[5.75rem]"><div class="absolute bottom-0 right-2 flex h-9 items-center"><div class="flex items-center rounded bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary px-2 font-sans text-xs text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary"><span class="" data-state="closed"><button class="flex gap-1 items-center select-none py-1" aria-label="Copy"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon-sm"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7 5C7 3.34315 8.34315 2 10 2H19C20.6569 2 22 3.34315 22 5V14C22 15.6569 20.6569 17 19 17H17V19C17 20.6569 15.6569 22 14 22H5C3.34315 22 2 20.6569 2 19V10C2 8.34315 3.34315 7 5 7H7V5ZM9 7H14C15.6569 7 17 8.34315 17 10V15H19C19.5523 15 20 14.5523 20 14V5C20 4.44772 19.5523 4 19 4H10C9.44772 4 9 4.44772 9 5V7ZM5 9C4.44772 9 4 9.44772 4 10V19C4 19.5523 4.44772 20 5 20H14C14.5523 20 15 19.5523 15 19V10C15 9.44772 14.5523 9 14 9H5Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg>Copy code</button></span></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-bash">npx prisma init

    ```
    
    This command creates a `prisma` directory with a `schema.prisma` file and a `.env` file for environment variables.
    
4.  **Configure MongoDB Connection**:
    
    -   **Set Up MongoDB Atlas**: Create a free cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) and obtain the connection string.
    -   **Update `.env`**: Replace the placeholder in `.env` with your MongoDB connection string:
        
        ```

### **2\. Database Modeling with Prisma**

Define your data models in `prisma/schema.prisma` to represent users, posts, and reactions:

```
<div class="contain-inline-size rounded-md border-[0.5px] border-token-border-medium relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary dark:bg-gray-950"><div class="flex items-center text-token-text-secondary px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md h-9 bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary select-none">prisma</div><div class="sticky top-9 md:top-[5.75rem]"><div class="absolute bottom-0 right-2 flex h-9 items-center"><div class="flex items-center rounded bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary px-2 font-sans text-xs text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary"><span class="" data-state="closed"><button class="flex gap-1 items-center select-none py-1" aria-label="Copy"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon-sm"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M7 5C7 3.34315 8.34315 2 10 2H19C20.6569 2 22 3.34315 22 5V14C22 15.6569 20.6569 17 19 17H17V19C17 20.6569 15.6569 22 14 22H5C3.34315 22 2 20.6569 2 19V10C2 8.34315 3.34315 7 5 7H7V5ZM9 7H14C15.6569 7 17 8.34315 17 10V15H19C19.5523 15 20 14.5523 20 14V5C20 4.44772 19.5523 4 19 4H10C9.44772 4 9 4.44772 9 5V7ZM5 9C4.44772 9 4 9.44772 4 10V19C4 19.5523 4.44772 20 5 20H14C14.5523 20 15 19.5523 15 19V10C15 9.44772 14.5523 9 14 9H5Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg>Copy code</button></span></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-prisma">datasource db {

  name          String
  email         String   @unique

  postId        String     @db.ObjectId
}
</code></div></div>
```

After defining the schema, generate the Prisma client:

```

### **3\. Authentication with Auth0 and Instagram Login**

1.  **Set Up Auth0 Application**:
    
    -   **Create Application**: In the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://auth0.com/), create a new Regular Web Application.
    -   **Configure Callbacks**: Set `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback` as the Allowed Callback URL and `http://localhost:3000` as the Allowed Logout URL.
2.  **Enable Instagram Social Connection**:
    
    -   **Configure Instagram**: In Auth0, navigate to **Connections** > **Social**, enable Instagram, and provide the necessary Client ID and Secret from the [Meta for Developers Console](https://developers.facebook.com/).
3.  **Configure Auth0 in Next.js**:
    
    -   **Install Auth0 Package**:

### **Authentication with Auth0**

**1\. Auth0 Setup**:

-   Create a new application in the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://auth0.com/).
-   Configure **Callback URLs** for login/logout (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`).
-   Enable **Instagram Login** in the Auth0 Social Connections section.

**2\. Implementation**:

-   Install Auth0 SDK:
    
    ```

### **Frontend Design with Shadcn UI**

**1\. Installation**:

-   Follow the Shadcn UI setup guide.

**2\. Custom Theme**:

-   Use Gadsden Panthers branding:
    -   Colors: Black (#000000) and Gold (#FFD700).
    -   Typography: Bold and modern.

**3\. Component Examples**:

-   **PostCard**: Displays posts with content, reactions, and timestamps.
-   **ReactionBar**: Allows users to react with emojis.

___

### **Implementation Strategy**

1.  **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**:
    
    -   Core features: Anonymous posting, real-time feed, and reactions.
    -   Authentication with Instagram login.
2.  **Iterative Development**:
    
    -   Phase 1: Add user profiles and streak-based gamification.
    -   Phase 2: Introduce live notifications and trending post highlights.
3.  **Testing and Optimization**:
    
    -   Unit tests for components and APIs using Jest.
    -   Integration tests for key workflows.
4.  **Deployment**:
    
    -   Utilize Vercel for automated builds.
    -   Monitor performance and scale MongoDB as needed.

### **Rationale**

This guide:

1.  **Covers End-to-End Development**:
    
    -   Combines architecture, setup, and development methodologies for a complete solution.
2.  **Focuses on Modern Technologies**:
    
    -   Aligns with the latest features in Next.js 15, React 19, and Shadcn UI.
3.  **Provides Practical Resources**:
    
    -   Directs to official documentation and actionable links for implementation.
4.  **Balances Concept and Execution**:
    
    -   Includes both high-level strategy and granular details for technical implementation.

By addressing each phase of development, this response serves as a **comprehensive blueprint** for the "Drama Drops" project. Let me know if additional technical guidance or specific implementation examples are required!
