# 🔁 SOP / Perpetual To-Do List

> This serves as an operational loop. It never ends. That's the point.

1. [ ] Use `paraNote` or snippet triggers when creating new notes
2. [ ] Ensure all notes contain complete frontmatter
3. [ ] Classify notes immediately (`type`, `status`, `zone`, `visibility`)
4. [ ] Apply correct template structure
5. [ ] Link related notes with `[[wikilinks]]`
6. [ ] Split notes that exceed \~150 lines into smaller ones (amoeba method)
7. [ ] Add `connections` manually or via suggestion
8. [ ] Set `visibility: public` to make notes publishable
9. [ ] Run graph build once per week
10. [ ] Archive stale or completed notes
11. [ ] Regularly update `traits.schema.json` as taxonomy evolves
12. [ ] Maintain the published site as a navigable codex
13. [ ] Never hallucinate structure; validate all suggestions
