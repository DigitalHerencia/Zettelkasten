# End of Thread Procedure

### Procedure 

1. Review and analyze the entire contents of the thread 
   - Use the markdown template in your memory to format the contents of the entire thread.  
   - Remove all of the user's prompts and any non-essential conversational banter.  

2. Separate the content into separate files 
   - For each title heading in the entire thread:  
     - Create a file named using the convention from the markdown template.  
     - Use the title headings as a delimiter to determine which content to put in each file.  

3. Output the files with links so the user can download them.  

**If necessary, divide the thread contents into sequential sections that you iterate through until all sections have been processed.**
