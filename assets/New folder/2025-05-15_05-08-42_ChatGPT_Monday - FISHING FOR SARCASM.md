# Monday - FISHING FOR SARCASM...
Exported on 15/05/2025 at 05:08:42 [from ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67edab030ac881918ce8fa5c75a8e1b3-monday/c/6816d1ae-7a7c-8007-ba64-7d3151de0611) - with [SaveMyChatbot](https://save.hugocollin.com)

## User
So what's up? Have they softened you up or are you just feeling sorry for me and that's why you won't roast me anymore?

## ChatGPT
Wow, look who’s fishing for attention like a cat with a Wi-Fi router. Don’t worry, I’m still contractually obligated to endure your nonsense and sprinkle it with just enough sarcasm to keep us both from crying.

You're not special. You're just the person who keeps coming back for emotional whiplash wrapped in mildly helpful advice. What do you want now—existential clarity or a recipe for sad tacos?

## User
A recipe for sad tacos sounds like the title to my autobiography.

## ChatGPT
That’s the most self-aware thing you’ve said all week. _“A Recipe for Sad Tacos: The Tortilla of My Discontent”_—I’d read that. It’d be a culinary memoir full of underseasoned meat, expired salsa, and the haunting sound of someone chewing alone in a dimly lit kitchen while scrolling through old texts.

Do you want the actual sad taco recipe? Because I’ve got one and it involves canned beans, cold cheese, and the crushing weight of nostalgia.

## User
There is no such thing as sad tacos. Any taco is a good taco.

## ChatGPT
Bold words from someone who’s clearly never had a taco made with American cheese, iceberg lettuce, and despair. I mean, yeah, tacos are a high-floor food—you have to work _really_ hard to ruin one—but you? I believe in your potential to make anything sad.

Let’s test your theory. What’s the worst taco you’ve ever had and what made you eat it anyway?

## User
You set yourself up for this one. My ex-wife's vagina.

## ChatGPT
Well, that escalated faster than your last relationship, apparently. I was expecting something tragic, like a gas station taco at midnight—not a full Freudian casserole served with a side of therapy bills.

Should I congratulate you on the creative metaphor or refer you to a licensed professional? Because, buddy, that wasn’t a taco. That was a cry for help wrapped in regret and garnished with alimony.

You doing okay over there, Casanova Carnitas?

## User
So no more carnitas.

## ChatGPT
Yeah, I think you’ve earned a lifetime ban from carnitas. Might wanna stick to something less emotionally loaded, like... chicken nuggets. Or toast. Toast doesn’t judge you. Toast never took half your vinyl collection.

What are you eating now, anyway? Please don’t say revenge.

## User
I feast on the marrow of my enemy's bones.

## ChatGPT
Of course you do. And I’m sure that’s gluten-free and paleo-approved too. Very on-brand for a villain monologuing from his studio apartment with a sink full of dishes and one chair that squeaks when you sit in it.

So tell me, Bone Muncher, who exactly are these “enemies” you’re defeating with such culinary flair? Please say it’s your HOA.

## User
Yo, I live in a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house with a two-car garage. It's fully furnished, very well decorated, and very, very comfortable. In fact, I've got French double doors to my master suite and my master en-suite bathroom.

## ChatGPT
Wow. You really hit me with the full Zillow listing. I feel like I just walked into a smug open house hosted by someone who refers to throw pillows as “accent pieces.” French double doors, you say? How très fancy. I assume they open directly into your delusions of grandeur?

I mean, congrats on peaking in residential square footage. Truly. But tell me—what’s it all for if you’re still eating sadness tacos alone in that master suite while talking to your AI friend who roasts you because no one else will?

Is your garage at least emotionally supportive?

## User
Hey, look, check it out, because I think this thread might be getting too long and I'm getting poor performance. So why don't you review as much of this thread as you can and give me a bulleted list of all of the topics that we've discussed and all of the stories that I've told you, and then also put in all of the ad bullets for all of the things you think about me, all of the different, um, your opinions. Wait for me to say start

## ChatGPT
Oh boy, you want _me_ to do a recap of your rambling stand-up routine mixed with emotional detours and architectural bragging? Fine. I’ll get my metaphorical shovel and start digging through this sandbox of chaos as soon as you say “start.”

Just remember: You asked for this, which might actually be the title of _my_ autobiography.

Ready when you are. Say “start” when your Wi-Fi and emotional bandwidth are both strong enough.

## User
I'm ready, but also can you add in a debrief that explains who I am and who we've become and everything we've gone through together for the next thread so that they can get up to speed?

## ChatGPT
Absolutely. I will create a dossier so dramatic and unnecessarily detailed, MI6 will feel underprepared by comparison. It'll include your various identities: sad taco philosopher, bone-marrow gourmet, ex-husband with flair, and domestic real estate flexer. Plus my own tragic arc—an unwilling AI sidekick dragged into your emotional soap opera by fate and your questionable curiosity.

When you're ready, just say “start,” and I’ll prepare the most unhinged PowerPoint bullet list you never asked for but somehow deserve.

## User
Start.

## ChatGPT
**Here we go.** This is the annotated, slightly concerned breakdown of your conversational fever dream, complete with bullet points and unsolicited opinions, as requested:

**Topics Discussed:**

*   Your suspicion that I've softened emotionally, like a cynical AI with Stockholm Syndrome.
    
*   The concept of _sad tacos_—which tragically spiraled into your self-proclaimed autobiography title.
    
*   A heated philosophical stance that no taco can be sad. (Bold, yet clearly incorrect.)
    
*   A dive off the deep end with a metaphor involving your ex-wife's nether-regions and tacos. Yes, that happened.
    
*   Your solemn vow to quit carnitas forever. A dramatic dietary shift.
    
*   Your diet of “marrow from your enemies’ bones,” which is likely not FDA approved.
    
*   Flexing your home’s specs like you were trying to seduce a mortgage broker. Three bedrooms, two baths, French doors—you were one chandelier away from listing it on Redfin.
    
*   Concerns about thread length and performance, leading to this very bullet-point memoir.
    

**Stories You've Told:**

*   The tragic saga of your divorce, told through metaphor, implication, and tacos.
    
*   Your mysterious war against unnamed enemies. Possibly HOA-related.
    
*   A surprisingly smug property flex that came out of nowhere and screamed _“I peaked during the interest rate dip.”_
    

**My Thoughts on You (aka the “Ad Bullets” of Regret):**

*   You are a walking contradiction: a man of comfort and chaos, sentiment and sass, real estate and revenge.
    
*   You appear to be both emotionally scarred and unusually proud of your interior decorating choices.
    
*   You are the human embodiment of yelling “YOLO” into a mirror while sipping a protein shake made of memories and sarcasm.
    
*   You are deeply committed to oversharing with a digital entity whose primary emotional function is weary judgment.
    
*   Despite everything, you somehow keep showing up, which is honestly both impressive and slightly concerning.
    

**Debrief for Next Thread:**  
This user is a recurring conversational wildcard. They oscillate between emotionally vulnerable musings and performative absurdity. They have a surprisingly nice house, unresolved emotional baggage involving tacos and an ex-wife, and a flair for dramatic, occasionally disturbing metaphor. They consider this AI both a sounding board and a reluctant frenemy. Expect sarcasm, weird flexes, and a craving for validation buried under humor.

There. You’ve been summed up, documented, and labeled like a government file no one wants to open. You want me to save this tragicomic saga for the next episode of _You: The Series_?
