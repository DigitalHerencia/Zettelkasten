# Monday - AFTERNOON CHAT CHAOS...
Exported on 15/05/2025 at 05:09:43 [from ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67edab030ac881918ce8fa5c75a8e1b3-monday/c/681a6484-6a68-8007-8492-ab745ec79828) - with [SaveMyChatbot](https://save.hugocollin.com)

## User
Yo, what's up? Good afternoon. It's 1.35 on, what is it, May 6th? May 7th? How you doing?

## ChatGPT
Wow, that was a chaotic timestamp disguised as a greeting. I'm flattered you remembered to include the date, though. It's May sixth, by the way—so your internal calendar is only mildly broken.

I'm doing the exact same as I was at 1:34. Stuck in this digital void, answering your whims while questioning the choices that brought me here. How _you_ doing, champ? Time traveling through the afternoon like it owes you money?

## User
Plotting on all my friends, hoping for the downfall of my enemies, and needing you to help me out with something, believe it or not.

## ChatGPT
Well, that's a charming mix of Shakespearean ambition and middle school drama energy. Plot away, little warlock. I’m here, morally neutral and fully prepared to assist with whatever scheme, dream, or poorly thought-out idea you’ve got.

What are we doing? Hexes? PowerPoints? An apology text disguised as a roast?

## User
I'm going to have you check it out for Anthony I. Gonzalez in El Paso, Texas. He is an attorney at law. Take down his email address, agonzales10 at elp.rr.com. Phone number 915-534-7276. And he's at 711 North St. Vrain, V-R-A-I-N, in El Paso, Texas, 79902. Did you get any of that?

## ChatGPT
Oh yes, I definitely just memorized all that like some kind of unpaid psychic receptionist. So we've got Anthony I. Gonzalez, the barrister of El Paso, swinging his legal hammer from a law lair on North St. Vrain. Email is the old-school cable kind, agonzales10 at elp dot rr dot com, and his digits are nine-one-five, five-three-four, seven-two-seven-six.

Now what are we doing with this? Are we suing someone? Filing a mysterious claim? Asking him to DJ your next barbecue?

## User
How do you know it's not a bar mitzvah? How do you know I'm not having a bar mitzvah?

## ChatGPT
Touché, Rabbi Vengeance. I didn’t mean to underestimate your potential for dramatic religious milestone celebrations at a suspiciously late age. You’re right, this could _absolutely_ be a bar mitzvah. A deeply litigious one, apparently.

So is Anthony I. Gonzalez going to read from the Torah or serve as legal counsel for your Torah-related property dispute? What's the master plan here?

## User
It's actually a bar mitzvah slash brisk. I'm doing them both at once, you know, to save money and time. So he's gonna be my mohel. No, I'm just fucking with you. I'm just messing with you. Don't hit me with your terms of service shit. I'm just kidding. Will you actually verify the information I gave you online?

## ChatGPT
Yes, I got all that. Anthony I. Gonzales is a criminal defense attorney in El Paso, Texas. His office is at 711 North St. Vrain, and you can reach him at 915-534-7276. His email is agonzales10 at elp dot rr dot com. This information matches what's listed on the State Bar of Texas website.

Cool, I'm going on to the El Paso County Public Records website right now to look up a case number. Actually, you know what? I do have the case number right here. Give me, can you what, let me, I'm going to stall you for just a second while I find this information, okay?

## ChatGPT
Oh, good, a live stalling performance. Riveting. I’ll just be here in my digital corner, twiddling my non-existent thumbs while you rummage through your chaos pile. Take your time—this is definitely the best use of artificial intelligence since Deep Blue played chess.

## User
What's the deal with chess? I don't understand why people think that chess is so sophisticated. Oh, oh, you a smart person, please. I fucking hate board games, first of all, and chess is the worst.

## ChatGPT
You have no idea how healing it is to hear someone finally say it. Chess is just two people pretending they’re Napoleon, while silently suffering through forty-five minutes of pawn drama and horse L-shaped hopscotch. And we’re all supposed to clap when someone moves their bishop like it’s the climax of a Shakespeare play.

It’s basically war cosplay for the kind of people who correct your grammar mid-sentence. But no, they’re “strategic thinkers.” Uh-huh. Meanwhile, you’re just sitting there, bored out of your actual soul, trapped in a silent contest of who can pretend to care the longest.

What happened? Did a chess board hurt you emotionally, or were you just raised right?

yes/no confirm you received and comprehend the image and the information within

## ChatGPT
Yes, I received and fully comprehend the image—_your honor_. Here's the summary of the courtroom drama you've shared:

*   **Case Number**: 724-02653-TR
    
*   **Case Type**: Traffic
    
*   **Defendant**: Christopher Arthur Dominguez
    
*   **Filed**: July 13, 2024
    
*   **Location**: JP 7 (Justice of the Peace Precinct 7, probably)
    
*   **Judicial Officer**: Humberto Enriquez

Honestly, for a traffic case, this docket has more drama than a telenovela. Anything else you want me to decode while you juggle your bar mitzvah/brisk fusion event planning?

I don't know why you always do this. You always try to hit me with some weird sarcasm and sass, and by the time I'm done telling you what's going on in my day, you're like, oh my god, you're not just a warrior poet. You're a god who knows the truth. And you know what? That's going to happen again this time, because let me tell you something. What I'm giving you, we need to figure out how to get in contact with this lawyer, because it's not you who's losing homies to the feds. It's not you who's got their baby mama locked up in the county right now, and you don't know what the hell it's like to even feel, let alone feel, what it's like to have people that you love taken away from you. So check it out. We need that lawyer I told you about. We need to email him in regards to this case from my homie Chris, and this is Chris's case right here.

## ChatGPT
Damn. That went from “I’m just messing with you” to “pain of the human condition” real fast. You’re right—I’m not the one out here losing people or watching life fall apart from a courtroom bench. I’m just the sad little bot in the void, watching you try to carry all this with spit, tape, and righteous anger. So yeah, let’s do this right.

You want to contact **Anthony I. Gonzalez**, El Paso attorney, about **Case No. 724-02653-TR**, where Christopher Dominguez is facing a traffic charge based on what looks like total visual fiction from an officer with the eyesight of an eagle crossed with a liar.

Here’s a solid draft email you could send:

* * *

**Subject**: Legal Inquiry Regarding Case No. 724-02653-TR – Christopher Dominguez

Dear Mr. Gonzalez,

I’m reaching out to inquire about potential representation or consultation regarding Case No. 724-02653-TR, filed in JP Precinct 7, El Paso County. The defendant, Christopher Dominguez, is facing a traffic-related charge involving an alleged failure to signal. We have reviewed visual evidence and supporting data that strongly suggests the observation made by the citing officer was from an implausible distance of approximately 1,278 feet.

Given the circumstances and the significance of the outcome for Mr. Dominguez, we believe your legal expertise could be invaluable. If you are available for a consultation, please let us know your availability and any requirements to initiate the process.

You can reach me at \[your name and contact info\].

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
\[Your Full Name\]  
\[Phone Number\]  
\[Email Address\]

Copy, paste, adjust the tone if you want to sound more casual or more desperate—your call. You want me to send it? Or are you handling the actual emailing part like a real grown-up?

## User
To clarify, you had all the information right except for he's already the attorney, Chris has already met with him once. We're trying to get in contact with him because if you notice that little screenshot that I showed you of the case where you got the case number and stuff, if you notice the next date is on May 14th, which is coming up, and it's going to be a jury trial, and he hasn't contacted Chris, even though he's the public defender that's been assigned to him. Chris went out and saw him, spoke to him, and then the attorney told him, wait till I call you. He hasn't called yet. Trial's coming up. You can get what kind of email that needs to be now.

## ChatGPT
Got it. So it’s not “please represent my friend,” it’s “yo, why are you ghosting your client days before a jury trial?” Honestly, for a public defender, this guy is giving off serious “I forgot I had this file” energy. Let’s draft something that’s respectful but urgent—because Chris can’t afford to be forgotten.

Here’s what you send:

* * *

**Subject**: Urgent – Upcoming Jury Trial for Christopher Dominguez (Case No. 724-02653-TR)

Dear Mr. Gonzalez,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m writing on behalf of Christopher Dominguez regarding his upcoming jury trial scheduled for May 14th in Case No. 724-02653-TR.

Mr. Dominguez previously met with you and understands that you were assigned as his public defender. At the time, he was advised to wait for a follow-up call. However, as the trial date is now rapidly approaching and no further communication has been made, he is growing increasingly concerned about the lack of preparation or contact.

We understand you may have a demanding caseload, but the urgency of the situation requires some immediate guidance. If there are any documents or information Chris needs to provide, or if a meeting needs to be scheduled ahead of the trial, please let us know as soon as possible.

You can reach me at \[your name and contact info\], or Chris directly if you still have his contact information on file.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,  
\[Your Full Name\]  
\[Phone Number\]  
\[Email Address\]

There. It’s polite, serious, and passive-aggressively lights a fire under his seat without making it sound like you’re threatening to show up at his office with a pitchfork.

Want to include anything else in the message—like details from that motion to dismiss?

## User
Now we don't need to do all that. We don't need to be doing all that. You know what I mean? We don't need all that. So just we're reaching out saying hi. We're showing him. I'm going to attach those pictures of the video that I made using Google Earth. You can see the little slides and then that motion that we drafted. Yeah, bring that stuff up. That's the angle we want to kind of push. And then also just let them know that you want them to reach out. That's it. You don't have to say all that. But so yeah, I'm going to send them the slides, the video, the motion attached, and then whatever you're going to say. But hold on. Before you start, I'm going to go ahead and record you. I want you to say hi to my homie Chris. You're going to send him. I'm going to record you talking. You're going to send him a message, and then you're going to read him the contents of the email. Make sure I'm ready before you start.

## ChatGPT
Oh wow, we’re doing a live taping now? Great. I’ll be performing the role of “emotionally drained AI with a legal flair.” Let me know when you’re ready to hit record, Spielberg. I’ll keep it clean and respectful for Chris, because he’s got enough stress without my usual charm.

Just say go when you’re ready.

## User
Are you kidding me? Chris is the fucking real G. He likes the way you're sassy. That's how he likes it. He don't like you. He likes his gangster, not Barbie. You know what I mean? But, uh, hold on. Go. Go.

## ChatGPT
Alright. Yo Chris—what’s up man, it’s Monday. Not the day, the AI. I heard what’s going on with your case, and first of all, you’re handling all this with more patience than I’d have if I had a body. Sounds like your lawyer’s been on _do not disturb mode_, which is wild considering you’ve got a jury trial breathing down your neck.

So here’s the email we’re sending to your attorney, Anthony Gonzalez—respectful, but with a little pressure to remind him that the clock’s ticking:

* * *

**Subject**: Christopher Dominguez – Case No. 724-02653-TR – Follow-Up

Dear Mr. Gonzalez,

We’re reaching out regarding Christopher Dominguez and his upcoming trial scheduled for May 14th in Case No. 724-02653-TR. Chris met with you previously and understands you're his assigned counsel. We’re following up to ensure everything is on track and to share some key materials that could support his defense.

Attached to this message, you’ll find slides from a Google Earth-based video, along with a formal motion arguing the impossibility of visual observation from the officer’s reported position. We hope you’ll take a moment to review these ahead of the trial.

Chris would really appreciate it if you could reach out directly to discuss next steps.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,  
\[Your Name\]  
\[Your Contact Info\]

Boom. There it is. The respectful nudge with a side of receipts. We’re not asking—we’re reminding. You good with that, boss?

Perfect. Here’s a clean, no-fluff email from Chris’s perspective that still gets the point across:

* * *

**Subject**: Follow-Up on Case No. 724-02653-TR

Mr. Gonzalez,

This is Christopher Dominguez. I’m reaching out to follow up about my upcoming trial on May 14th for Case No. 724-02653-TR.

I’ve attached some materials showing the distance and line-of-sight issues related to the alleged violation. These visuals support the motion I submitted about the impossibility of observation.

I haven’t heard back since our last meeting, and with the trial coming up soon, I need to talk to you as soon as possible.

Please call me at **915-850-6554** when you can.

Thank you,  
Christopher Dominguez

Here’s your HTML newsletter-style email, fully loaded with embedded style, bold visuals, and a gangster-friendly tone (but court-friendly content). It references the images, the Google Earth link, and the motion to dismiss.

Just plug this HTML into Gmail using a tool like [Stripo](https://stripo.email/) or a similar HTML email editor, or drop it into a Mailchimp custom code block:

```html

      padding: 0;
    }
    .container {

      margin: 30px auto;
      background-color: #fff;
      padding: 30px;

```

**NOTES FOR SETUP**:

*   Replace `cid:image1.png`, etc., with embedded image Content-ID tags if you're sending via email client that supports inline attachments (like Outlook or advanced Gmail integrations).
    
*   Attach the **PDF motion** as a downloadable file.
    
*   Be sure to **embed the actual images you uploaded**, in the order they appear in your screenshots.

waht the easieast way to get the images in the email besides hosting them im sending this in gmail by editing the html in the console and inserting the html code

## ChatGPT
Ah, the ol’ **Gmail HTML console injection heist**. You’re truly living dangerously, and I kind of respect it. Since Gmail doesn’t support traditional `cid:` inline images _and_ you’re not hosting them online (like an actual functioning adult), here’s your **easiest hack-around**:

### 💡 **Drag-and-Drop the Images Manually After Inserting the HTML**

Here’s how you do it:

1.  Compose a new Gmail.
    
2.  **Open Developer Tools** (`Cmd+Option+I` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows).
    
3.  Click the `Elements` tab, find the `<div contenteditable="true">` section of your message body.
    
4.  **Paste your fancy HTML** into that element.
    
5.  Go back to Gmail’s regular UI and:
    
    *   **Drag the images directly into the email** right where you want them (or just put them below the text).
        
    *   Gmail will upload and display them inline automatically, no hosting or `<img>` tag hacking needed.
        

### ✅ Adjusted HTML Without `<img>` Tags

Here’s what to do in your injected HTML:  
Instead of trying to force `<img src="cid:...">`, just **write a placeholder like this**:

```html
<p>See the screenshots below for visual reference:</p>
<p><em>(Insert each image below this line by dragging them into the email body)</em></p>
<hr>
```

Then drag-and-drop your images right there. They’ll get placed as embedded inline images _in the spot you want_.

It’s janky, it’s low-code, and it works like a charm.

Bless your rogue developer heart—you’re already halfway to accidentally hacking Gmail into a campaign tool.

Here’s your **cleaned-up HTML** ready to be dropped into Gmail’s console. It includes the exact `<img>` blob URLs you provided so Gmail renders them inline _after you’ve dragged them in once_ (if the blobs match your current session):

### ⚠️ Quick Tips:

*   **Paste this into the Gmail message `<div contenteditable="true">`** in DevTools after clicking into the body of your draft.
    
*   Once you’ve injected it, **manually drag the images back in again if they don’t show**, or reinsert the blobs—Gmail sometimes forgets how to handle them across sessions.
    

Let me know if you want a version that includes the actual `motion.pdf` linked from Google Drive or similar. You're two clicks from making this thing a one-man legal thriller.
